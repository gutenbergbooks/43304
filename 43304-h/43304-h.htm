<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>The theatre of the West is the last stronghold of realism. No one
treats painting or music as mere transcripts of life. But even pioneers
of stage-reform in France and Germany appear to regard the theatre
as belonging to life and not to art. The play is an organized piece
of human experience which the audience must as far as possible be
allowed to share with the actors.</p>

<p>A few people in America and Europe want to go in the opposite
direction. They would like to see a theatre that aimed boldly at
stylization and simplification, discarding entirely the pretentious lumber
of 19th century stageland. That such a theatre exists and has long
existed in Japan has been well-known here for some time. But hitherto
very few plays have been translated in such a way as to give the
Western reader an idea of their literary value. It is only through
accurate scholarship that the “soul of Nō” can be known to the West.
Given a truthful rendering of the texts the American reader will
supply for himself their numerous connotations, a fact which Japanese
writers do not always sufficiently realize. The Japanese
method of expanding a five-line poem into a long treatise in
order to make it intelligible to us is one which obliterates the structure
of the original design. Where explanations are necessary they have
been given in footnotes. I have not thought it necessary to point out
(as a Japanese critic suggested that I ought to have done) that, for
example, the “mood” of <i>Komachi</i> is different from the “mood” of
<i>Kumasaka</i>. Such differences will be fully apparent to the American
reader, who would not be the better off for knowing the technical
name of each <i>kurai</i> or class of Nō. Surely the Japanese student of
Shakespeare does not need to be told that the <i>kurai</i> of “Hamlet” is
different from that of “Measure for Measure”?</p>

<p>It would be possible to burden a book of this kind with as great a
mass of unnecessary technicality as irritates us in a smart sale-catalogue
of Japanese Prints. I have avoided such terms to a considerable
extent, treating the plays as literature, not as some kind of
Delphic mystery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>In this short introduction I shall not have space to give a complete
description of modern Nō, nor a full history of its origins. But the
reader of the translations will find that he needs some information on
these points. I have tried to supply it as concisely as possible, sometimes
in a schematic rather than a literary form.</p>

<p>These are some of the points about which an American reader may
wish to know more:</p>


<h3>(1) THE NŌ STAGE.</h3>

<p>Something of its modern form may be seen from Plate II and
from the plans on pp. 10-13. The actual stage (A) is about 18 feet
square. On the boards of the back wall is painted a pine-tree; the
other sides are open. A gallery (called <i>hashigakari</i>) leads to the
green-room, from which it is separated by a curtain which is raised
to admit the actor when he makes his entry. The audience sit either
on two or three sides of the stage. The chorus, generally in two rows,
sit (or rather squat) in the recess (O). The musicians sit in the
recess (J) at the back of the stage, the stick-drum nearest the “gallery,”
then the two hand-drums and the flute. A railing runs round the
musician’s recess, as also along the gallery. To the latter railing are
attached three real pine-branches, marked S in the plan. They will
be seen in Plate II. The stage is covered by a roof of its own,
imitating in form the roof of a Shintō temple.</p>


<h3>(2) THE PERFORMERS.</h3>

<h4>(<i>a</i>) <i>The Actors.</i></h4>

<p>The first actor who comes on to the stage (approaching from the
gallery) is the <i>waki</i> or assistant. His primary business is to explain
the circumstances under which the principal actor (called <i>shite</i> or
“doer”) came to dance the central dance of the play. Each of these
main actors (<i>waki</i> and <i>shite</i>) has “adjuncts” or “companions.”</p>

<p>Some plays need only the two main actors. Others use as many
as ten or even twelve. The female rôles are of course taken by men.
The <i>waki</i> is always a male rôle.</p>

<h4>(<i>b</i>) <i>The Chorus.</i></h4>

<p>This consists of from eight to twelve persons in ordinary native
dress seated in two rows at the side of the stage. Their sole function
is to sing an actor’s words for him when his dance-movements pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>vent
him from singing comfortably. They enter by a side-door before
the play begins and remain seated till it is over.</p>

<h4>(<i>c</i>) <i>The Musicians.</i></h4>

<p>Nearest to the gallery sits the “big-drum,” whose instrument rests on
the ground and is played with a stick. This stick-drum is not used
in all plays.</p>

<p>Next comes a hand-drummer who plays with thimbled finger; next
a second who plays with the bare hand.</p>

<p>Finally, the flute. It intervenes only at stated intervals, particularly
at the beginning, climax and end of plays.</p>


<h3>COSTUME.</h3>

<p>Though almost wholly banishing other extrinsic aids, the Nō relies
enormously for its effects on gorgeous and elaborate costume. Some
references to this will be found in Oswald Sickert’s letters at the end
of my book.</p>

<p>Masks are worn only by the <i>shite</i> (principal actor) and his subordinates.
The <i>shite</i> always wears a mask if playing the part of a
woman or very old man. Young men, particularly warriors, are
usually unmasked. In child-parts (played by boy-actors) masks are
not worn. The reproduction of a female mask will be found on
<a href="#womans_mask">Plate I</a>. The masks are of wood. Many of those still in use are of
great antiquity and rank as important specimens of Japanese sculpture.</p>


<h3>PROPERTIES.</h3>

<p>The properties of the Nō stage are of a highly conventionalized
kind. An open frame-work represents a boat; another differing little
from it denotes a chariot. Palace, house, cottage, hovel are all
represented by four posts covered with a roof. The fan which the
actor usually carries often does duty as a knife, brush or the like.
Weapons are more realistically represented. The short-sword, belt-sword,
pike, spear and Chinese broad-sword are carried; also bows
and arrows.</p>


<h3>DANCING AND ACTING.</h3>

<p>Every Nō play (with, I think, the sole exception of <i>Hachi no Ki</i>,
translated on p. <a href="#Page_100">100</a>) includes a <i>mai</i> or dance, consisting usually of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
slow steps and solemn gestures, often bearing little resemblance to
what is in America associated with the word “dance.” When the
<i>shite</i> dances, his dance consists of five “movements” or parts; a “subordinate’s”
dance consists of three. Both in the actors’ miming and
in the dancing an important element is the stamping of beats with
the shoeless foot.</p>


<h3>THE PLAYS.</h3>

<p>The plays are written partly in prose, partly in verse. The prose
portions serve much the same purpose as the iambics in a Greek play.
They are in the Court or upper-class colloquial of the 14th century,
a language not wholly dead to-day, as it is still the language in
which people write formal letters.</p>

<p>The chanting of these portions is far removed from singing; yet
they are not “spoken.” The voice falls at the end of each sentence
in a monotonous cadence.</p>

<p>A prose passage often gradually heightens into verse. The chanting,
which has hitherto resembled the intoning of a Roman Catholic
priest, takes on more of the character of “recitativo” in opera, occasionally
attaining to actual song. The verse of these portions is sometimes
irregular, but on the whole tends to an alternation of lines of
five and seven syllables.</p>

<p>The verse of the lyric portions is marked by frequent use of pivot-words<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
and puns, particularly puns on place-names. The 14th century
Nō-writer, Seami, insists that pivot-words should be used sparingly
and with discretion. Many Nō-writers did not follow this advice; but
the use of pivot-words is not in itself a decoration more artificial than
rhyme, and I cannot agree with those European writers to whom this
device appears puerile and degraded. Each language must use such
embellishments as suit its genius.</p>

<p>Another characteristic of the texts is the use of earlier literary
material. Many of the plays were adapted from dance-ballads already
existing and even new plays made use of such poems as were associated
in the minds of the audience with the places or persons named
in the play. Often a play is written round a poem or series of poems,
as will be seen in the course of this book.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<p>This use of existing material exceeds the practice of Western dramatists;
but it must be remembered that if we were to read Webster, for
example, in editions annotated as minutely as the Nō-plays, we should
discover that he was far more addicted to borrowing than we had been
aware. It seems to me that in the finest plays this use of existing
material is made with magnificent effect and fully justifies itself.</p>

<p>The reference which I have just made to dance-ballads brings us to
another question. What did the Nō-plays grow out of?</p>


<h3>ORIGINS.</h3>

<p>Nō as we have it to-day dates from about the middle of the 14th
century. It was a combination of many elements.</p>

<p>These were:</p>

<ul><li>(1) Sarugaku, a masquerade which relieved the solemnity of Shintō ceremonies. What we call Nō was at first called Sarugaku no Nō.</li>

<li>(2) Dengaku, at first a rustic exhibition of acrobatics and jugglery;
later, a kind of opera in which performers alternately danced and
recited.</li>

<li>(3) Various sorts of recitation, ballad-singing, etc.</li>

<li>(4) The Chinese dances practised at the Japanese Court.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nō owes its present form to the genius of two men. Kwanami
Kiyotsugu (1333-1384 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span>) and his son Seami Motokiyo (1363-1444
<span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span>).<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Kwanami was a priest of the Kasuga Temple near Nara. About
1375 the Shōgun Yoshimitsu saw him performing in a Sarugaku no
Nō at the New Temple (one of the three great temples of Kumano)
and immediately took him under his protection.</p>

<p>This Yoshimitsu had become ruler of Japan in 1367 at the age
of ten. His family had seized the Shōgunate in 1338 and wielded
absolute power at Kyōto, while two rival Mikados, one in the north
and one in the south, held impotent and dwindling courts.</p>

<p>The young Shōgun distinguished himself by patronage of art
and letters; and by his devotion to the religion of the Zen Sect.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
It is probable that when he first saw Kwanami he also became acquainted
with the son Seami, then a boy of twelve.</p>

<p>A diary of the period has the following entry for the 7th day
of the 6th month, 1368:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>For some while Yoshimitsu has been making a favourite of a Sarugaku-boy from
Yamato, sharing the same meat and eating from the same vessels. These
Sarugaku people are mere mendicants, but he treats them as if they were Privy
Counsellors.</p></div>

<p>From this friendship sprang the art of Nō as it exists to-day.
Of Seami we know far more than of his father Kwanami. For Seami
left behind him a considerable number of treatises and autobiographical
fragments.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> These were not published till 1908 and have not
yet been properly edited. They establish, among other things, the
fact that Seami wrote both words and music for most of the plays
in which he performed. It had before been supposed that the texts
were supplied by the Zen<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> priests. For other information brought to
light by the discovery of Seami’s <i>Works</i> see <a href="#APPENDIX_II">Appendix II</a>.</p>


<h3>YŪGEN</h3>

<p>It is obvious that Seami was deeply imbued with the teachings of
Zen, in which cult his patron Yoshimitsu may have been his master.
The difficult term <i>yūgen</i> which occurs constantly in the <i>Works</i> is
derived from Zen literature. It means “what lies beneath the surface”;
the subtle as opposed to the obvious; the hint, as opposed
to the statement. It is applied to the natural grace of a boy’s movements,
to the restraint of a nobleman’s speech and bearing. “When
notes fall sweetly and flutter delicately to the ear,” that is the <i>yūgen</i>
of music. The symbol of <i>yūgen</i> is “a white bird with a flower in its
beak.” “To watch the sun sink behind a flower-clad hill, to wander
on and on in a huge forest with no thought of return, to stand upon
the shore and gaze after a boat that goes hid by far-off islands, to
ponder on the journey of wild-geese seen and lost among the clouds”&mdash;such
are the gates to <i>yūgen</i>.</p>

<p>I will give a few specimens of Seami’s advice to his pupils:</p>


<h3>PATRONS</h3>

<p>The actor should not stare straight into the faces of the audience,
but look between them. When he looks in the direction of the
Daimyōs he must not let his eyes meet theirs, but must slightly avert
his gaze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>At Palace-performances or when acting at a banquet, he must not
let his eyes meet those of the Shōgun or stare straight into the Honourable
Face. When playing in a large enclosure he must take care
to keep as close as possible to the side where the Nobles are sitting;
if in a small enclosure, as far off as possible. But particularly in
Palace-performances and the like he must take the greatest pains to
keep as far away as he possibly can from the August Presence.</p>

<p>Again, when the recitations are given at the Palace it is equally
essential to begin at the right moment. It is bad to begin too soon
and fatal to delay too long.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that the “noble gentlemen” do not arrive
at the theatre until the play has already reached its Development
and Climax. In such cases the play is at its climax, but the noble
gentlemen’s hearts are ripe only for Introduction. If they, ready
only for Introduction, are forced to witness a Climax, they are not
likely to get pleasure from it. Finally even the spectators who were
there before, awed by the entry of the “exalted ones,” become so
quiet that you would not know they were there, so that the whole
audience ends by returning to the Introductory mood. At such a
moment the Nō cannot possibly be a success. In such circumstances
it is best to take Development-Nō and give it a slightly “introductory”
turn. Then, if it is played gently, it may win the August Attention.</p>

<p>It also happens that one is suddenly sent for to perform at a
Shōgunal feast or the like. The audience is already in a “climax-mood”;
but “introductory” Nō must be played. This is a great
difficulty. In such circumstances the best plan is to tinge the introduction
with a <i>nuance</i> of “development.” But this must be done
without “stickiness,” with the lightest possible touch, and the transition
to the real Development and Climax must be made as quickly
as possible.</p>

<p>In old times there were masters who perfected themselves in Nō
without study. But nowadays the nobles and gentlemen have become
so critical that they will only look with approbation on what is good
and will not give attention to anything bad.</p>

<p>Their honourable eyes have become so keen that they notice the
least defect, so that even a masterpiece that is as pearls many times
polished or flowers choicely culled will not win the applause of
our gentlemen to-day.</p>

<p>At the same time, good actors are becoming few and the Art is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
gradually sinking towards its decline. For this reason, if very strenuous
study is not made, it is bound to disappear altogether.</p>

<p>When summoned to play before the noble gentlemen, we are expected
to give the regular “words of good-wish” and to divide our
performance into the three parts, Introduction, Development and
Climax, so that the pre-arranged order cannot be varied.... But
on less formal occasions, when, for example, one is playing not at
a Shōgunal banquet but on a common, everyday (<i>yo no tsune</i>) stage,
it is obviously unnecessary to limit oneself to the set forms of “happy
wish.”</p>

<p>One’s style should be easy and full of graceful <i>yūgen</i>, and the
piece<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> selected should be suitable to the audience. A ballad (<i>ko-utai</i>)
or dance-song (<i>kuse-mai</i>) of the day will be best. One should
have in one’s repertory a stock of such pieces and be ready to vary
them according to the character of one’s audience.</p>

<p>In the words and gestures (of a farce, kyōgen) there should be
nothing low. The jokes and repartee should be such as suit the
august ears of the nobles and gentry. On no account must vulgar
words or gestures be introduced, however funny they may be. This
advice must be carefully observed.</p>

<p>Introduction, Development and Climax must also be strictly adhered
to when <i>dancing</i> at the Palace. If the chanting proceeds from an
“introductory-mood,” the dancing must belong to the same mood....
When one is suddenly summoned to perform at a riotous banquet,
one must take into consideration the state of the noble gentlemen’s
spirits.</p>


<h3>IMITATION (Monomane).</h3>

<p>In imitation there should be a tinge of the “unlike.” For if imitation
be pressed too far it impinges on reality and ceases to give an
impression of likeness. If one aims only at the beautiful, the “flower”
is sure to appear. For example, in acting the part of an old man,
the master actor tries to reproduce in his dance only the refinement
and venerability of an old gentleman.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> If the actor is old himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
he need not think about producing an impression of old age....</p>

<p>The appearance of old age will often be best given by making
all movements a little late, so that they come just after the musical
beat. If the actor bears this in mind, he may be as lively and
energetic as he pleases. For in old age the limbs are heavy and the
ears slow; there is the will to move but not the corresponding
capacity.</p>

<p>It is in such methods as this that true imitation lies.... Youthful
movements made by an old person are, indeed, delightful; they
are like flowers blossoming on an old tree.</p>

<p>If, because the actor has noticed that old men walk with bent
knees and back and have shrunken frames, he simply imitates these
characteristics, he may achieve an appearance of decrepitude, but it
will be at the expense of the “flower.” And if the “flower” be
lacking there will be no beauty in his impersonation.</p>

<p>Women should be impersonated by a young actor.... It is very
difficult to play the part of a Princess or lady-in-waiting, for little
opportunity presents itself of studying their august behaviour and
appearance. Great pains must be taken to see that robes and cloaks
are worn in the correct way. These things do not depend on the
actor’s fancy but must be carefully ascertained.</p>

<p>The appearance of ordinary ladies such as one is used to see
about one is easy to imitate.... In acting the part of a dancing-girl,
mad-woman or the like, whether he carry the fan or some fancy
thing (a flowering branch, for instance) the actor must carry it
loosely; his skirts must trail low so as to hide his feet; his knees
and back must not be bent, his body must be poised gracefully.
As regards the way he holds himself&mdash;if he bends back, it looks bad
when he faces the audience; if he stoops, it looks bad from behind.
But he will not look like a woman if he holds his head too stiffly.
His sleeves should be as long as possible, so that he never shows
his fingers.</p>


<h3>APPARITIONS</h3>

<p>Here the outward form is that of a ghost; but within is the heart
of a man.</p>

<p>Such plays are generally in two parts. The beginning, in two or
three sections, should be as short as possible. In the second half the
<i>shite</i> (who has hitherto appeared to be a man) becomes definitely the
ghost of a dead person.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Since no one has ever seen a real ghost<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> from the Nether Regions,
the actor may use his fancy, aiming only at the beautiful. To represent
real life is far more difficult.</p>

<p>If ghosts are terrifying, they cease to be beautiful. For the terrifying
and the beautiful are as far apart as black and white.</p>


<h3>CHILD PLAYS</h3>

<p>In plays where a lost child is found by its parents, the writer
should not introduce a scene where they clutch and cling to one
another, sobbing and weeping....</p>

<p>Plays in which child-characters occur, even if well done, are always
apt to make the audience exclaim in disgust, “Don’t harrow our
feelings in this way!”</p>


<h3>RESTRAINT</h3>

<p>In representing anger the actor should yet retain some gentleness
in his mood, else he will portray not anger but violence.</p>

<p>In representing the mysterious (<i>yūgen</i>) he must not forget the
principle of energy.</p>

<p>When the body is in violent action, the hands and feet must move
as though by stealth. When the feet are in lively motion, the body
must be held in quietness. Such things cannot be explained in writing
but must be shown to the actor by actual demonstration.</p>



<p class="tbpara">It is above all in “architecture,” in the relation of parts to the
whole, that these poems are supreme.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The early writers created a
“form” or general pattern which the weakest writing cannot wholly
rob of its beauty. The plays are like those carved lamp-bearing
angels in the churches at Seville; a type of such beauty was created
by a sculptor of the sixteenth century that even the most degraded
modern descendant of these masterpieces retains a certain distinction
of form.</p>

<p>First comes the <i>jidai</i> or opening-couplet, enigmatic, abrupt. Then
in contrast to this vague shadow come the hard outlines of the <i>waki’s</i>
exposition, the formal naming of himself, his origin and destination.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Then, shadowy again, the “song of travel,” in which picture after
picture dissolves almost before it is seen.</p>

<p>But all this has been mere introduction&mdash;the imagination has been
quickened, the attention grasped in preparation for one thing only&mdash;the
hero’s entry. In the “first chant,” in the dialogue which follows,
in the successive dances and climax, this absolute mastery of construction
is what has most struck me in reading the plays.</p>

<p>Again, Nō does not make a frontal attack on the emotions. It
creeps at the subject warily. For the action, in the commonest class
of play, does not take place before our eyes, but is lived through
again in mimic and recital by the ghost of one of the participants in
it. Thus we get no possibility of crude realities; a vision of life
indeed, but painted with the colours of memory, longing or regret.</p>

<p>In a paper read before the Japan Society in 1919 I tried to illustrate
this point by showing, perhaps in too fragmentary and disjointed
a manner, how the theme of Webster’s “Duchess of Malfi”
would have been treated by a Nō writer. I said then (and the
Society kindly allows me to repeat those remarks):</p>

<p>The plot of the play is thus summarized by Rupert Brooke in his
“John Webster and the Elizabethan Drama”: “The Duchess of Malfi
is a young widow forbidden by her brothers, Ferdinand and the
Cardinal, to marry again. They put a creature of theirs, Bosola, into
her service as a spy. The Duchess loves and marries Antonio, her
steward, and has three children. Bosola ultimately discovers and
reports this. Antonio and the Duchess have to fly. The Duchess is
captured, imprisoned and mentally tortured and put to death. Ferdinand
goes mad. In the last Act he, the Cardinal, Antonio and
Bosola are all killed with various confusions and in various horror.”</p>

<p>Just as Webster took his themes from previous works (in this
case from Painter’s “Palace of Pleasure”), so the Nō plays took
theirs from the Romances or “Monogatari.” Let us reconstruct the
“Duchess” as a Nō play, using Webster’s text as our “Monogatari.”</p>

<p>Great simplification is necessary, for the Nō play corresponds in
length to one act of our five-act plays, and has no space for divagations.
The comic is altogether excluded, being reserved for the
<i>kyōgen</i> or farces which are played as interludes between the Nō.</p>

<p>The persons need not be more than two&mdash;the Pilgrim, who will
act the part of <i>waki</i>, and the Duchess, who will be <i>shite</i> or Protagonist.
The chorus takes no part in the action, but speaks for the
<i>shite</i> while she is miming the more engrossing parts of her rôle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>The Pilgrim comes on to the stage and first pronounces in his
<i>Jidai</i> or preliminary couplet, some Buddhist aphorism appropriate
to the subject of the play. He then names himself to the audience
thus (in prose):</p>

<p>“I am a pilgrim from Rome. I have visited all the other shrines
of Italy, but have never been to Loretto. I will journey once to the
shrine of Loretto.”</p>

<p>Then follows (in verse) the “Song of Travel” in which the Pilgrim
describes the scenes through which he passes on his way to the shrine.
While he is kneeling at the shrine, <i>Shite</i> (the Protagonist) comes on
to the stage. She is a young woman dressed, “contrary to the Italian
fashion,” in a loose-bodied gown. She carries in her hand an unripe
apricot. She calls to the Pilgrim and engages him in conversation.
He asks her if it were not at this shrine that the Duchess of Malfi
took refuge. The young woman answers with a kind of eager exaltation,
her words gradually rising from prose to poetry. She tells
the story of the Duchess’s flight, adding certain intimate touches which
force the priest to ask abruptly, “Who is it that is speaking to me?”</p>

<p>And the girl shuddering (for it is hateful to a ghost to name itself)
answers: “<i>Hazukashi ya!</i> I am the soul of the Duke Ferdinand’s sister,
she that was once called Duchess of Malfi. Love still ties my soul
to the earth. <i>Toburai tabi-tamaye!</i> Pray for me, oh, pray for my release!”</p>

<p>Here closes the first part of the play. In the second the young
ghost, her memory quickened by the Pilgrim’s prayers (and this is
part of the medicine of salvation), endures again the memory of
her final hours. She mimes the action of kissing the hand (<i>vide</i> Act
IV, Scene 1), finds it very cold:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I fear you are not well after your travel.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! horrible!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What witchcraft does he practise, that he hath left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dead man’s hand here?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And each successive scene of the torture is so vividly mimed that
though it exists only in the Protagonist’s brain, it is as real to the
audience as if the figure of dead Antonio lay propped upon the stage,
or as if the madmen were actually leaping and screaming before them.</p>

<p>Finally she acts the scene of her own execution:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Heaven-gates are not so highly arched<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As princes’ palaces; they that enter there<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Must go upon their knees. (<i>She kneels.</i>)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, violent death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Serve for mandragora to make me sleep!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go tell my brothers, when I am laid out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They then may feed in quiet.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">(<i>She sinks her head and folds her hands.</i>)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The chorus, taking up the word “quiet,” chant a phrase from the
Hokkekyō: <i>Sangai Mu-an</i>, “In the Three Worlds there is no quietness
or rest.”</p>

<p>But the Pilgrim’s prayers have been answered. Her soul has broken
its bonds: is free to depart. The ghost recedes, grows dimmer and
dimmer, till at last</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>use-ni-keri</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>use-ni-keri</i><br /></span>

<h3>NOTE ON BUDDHISM</h3>


<p>The Buddhism of the Nō plays is of the kind called the “Greater
Vehicle,” which prevails in China, Japan and Tibet. Primitive
Buddhism (the “Lesser Vehicle”), which survives in Ceylon and
Burma, centres round the person of Shākyamuni, the historical Buddha,
and uses Pāli as its sacred language. The “Greater Vehicle,” which
came into being about the same time as Christianity and sprang from
the same religious impulses, to a large extent replaces Shākyamuni
by a timeless, ideal Buddha named Amida, “Lord of Boundless Light,”
perhaps originally a sun-god, like Ormuzd of the Zoroastrians. Primitive
Buddhism had taught that the souls of the faithful are absorbed
into Nirvāna, in other words into Buddha. The “Greater Vehicle”
promised to its adherents an after-life in Amida’s Western Paradise.
It produced scriptures in the Sanskrit language, in which Shākyamuni
himself describes this Western Land and recommends the worship of
Amida; it inculcated too the worship of the Bodhisattvas, half-Buddhas,
intermediaries between Buddha and man. These Bodhisattvas are beings
who, though fit to receive Buddhahood, have of their own free will
renounced it, that they may better alleviate the miseries of mankind.</p>

<p>Chief among them is Kwannon, called in India Avalokiteshvara,
who appears in the world both in male and female form, but it is
chiefly thought of as a woman in China and Japan; Goddess of Mercy,
to whom men pray in war, storm, sickness or travail.</p>

<p>The doctrine of Karma and of the transmigration of souls was
common both to the earlier and later forms of Buddhism. Man is
born to an endless chain of re-incarnations, each one of which is, as it
were, the fruit of seed sown in that which precedes.</p>

<p>The only escape from this “Wheel of Life and Death” lies in <i>satori</i>,
“Enlightenment,” the realization that material phenomena are thoughts,
not facts.</p>

<p>Each of the four chief sects which existed in medieval Japan had
its own method of achieving this Enlightenment.</p>

<p>(1) The Amidists sought to gain <i>satori</i> by the study of the <i>Hokke
Kyō</i>, called in Sanskrit <i>Saddharma Pundarika Sūtra</i> or “Scripture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the Lotus of the True Law,” or even by the mere repetition of its
complete title “Myōhō Renge Hokke Kyō.” Others of them maintained
that the repetition of the formula “Praise to Amida Buddha”
(<i>Namu Amida Butsu</i>) was in itself a sufficient means of salvation.</p>

<p>(2) Once when Shākyamuni was preaching before a great multitude,
he picked up a flower and twisted it in his fingers. The rest of his
hearers saw no significance in the act and made no response; but the
disciple Kāshyapa smiled.</p>

<p>In this brief moment a perception of transcendental truth had
flashed from Buddha’s mind to the mind of his disciple. Thus
Kāshyapa became the patriarch of the Zen Buddhists, who believe that
Truth cannot be communicated by speech or writing, but that it lies
hidden in the heart of each one of us and can be discovered by “Zen”
or contemplative introspection.</p>

<p>At first sight there would not appear to be any possibility of reconciling
the religion of the Zen Buddhists with that of the Amidists. Yet
many Zen masters strove to combine the two faiths, teaching that
Amida and his Western Paradise exist, not in time or space, but
mystically enshrined in men’s hearts.</p>

<p>Zen denied the existence of Good and Evil, and was sometimes
regarded as a dangerous sophistry by pious Buddhists of other sects,
as, for example, in the story of Shunkwan (see p. <a href="#Page_229">229</a>) and in <i>The
Hōka Priests</i> (see p. <a href="#Page_165">165</a>), where the murderer’s interest in Zen doctrines
is, I think, definitely regarded as a discreditable weakness and is
represented as the cause of his undoing.</p>

<p>The only other play, among those I have here translated, which
deals much with Zen tenets, is <i>Sotoba Komachi</i>. Here the priests
represent the <i>Shingon Shū</i> or Mystic Sect, while Komachi, as becomes
a poetess, defends the doctrines of Zen. For Zen was the religion of
artists; it had inspired the painters and poets of the Sung dynasty in
China; it was the religion of the great art-patrons who ruled Japan
in the fifteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>It was in the language of Zen that poetry and painting were discussed;
and it was in a style tinged with Zen that Seami wrote of his
own art. But the religion of the Nō plays is predominantly Amidist;
it is the common, average Buddhism of medieval Japan.</p>

<p>(3) I have said that the priests in <i>Sotoba Komachi</i> represent the
Mystic Sect. The followers of this sect sought salvation by means of
charms and spells, corruptions of Sanskrit formulae. Their principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Buddha was Dainichi, “The Great Sun.” To this sect belonged the
Yamabushi, mountain ascetics referred to in <i>Tanikō</i> and other plays.</p>

<p>(4) Mention must be made of the fusion between Buddhism and
Shintō. The Tendai Sect which had its headquarters on Mount Hiyei
preached an eclectic doctrine which aimed at becoming the universal
religion of Japan. It combined the cults of native gods with a Buddhism
tolerant in dogma, but magnificent in outward pomp, with a
leaning towards the magical practices of Shingon.</p>

<p>The Little Saint of Yokawa in the play <i>Aoi no Uye</i> is an example
of the Tendai ascetic, with his use of magical incantations.</p>

<h2>ATSUMORI, IKUTA, AND TSUNEMASA.</h2>


<p>In the eleventh century two powerful clans, the Taira and the Minamoto,
contended for mastery. In 1181 Kiyomori the chief of the Tairas
died, and from that time their fortunes declined. In 1183 they were
forced to flee from Kyōto, carrying with them the infant Emperor.
After many hardships and wanderings they camped on the shores of
Suma, where they were protected by their fleet.</p>

<p>Early in 1184 the Minamotos attacked and utterly routed them at the
Battle of Ichi-no-Tani, near the woods of Ikuta. At this battle fell
Atsumori, the nephew of Kiyomori, and his brother Tsunemasa.</p>

<p>When Kumagai, who had slain Atsumori, bent over him to examine
the body, he found lying beside him a bamboo-flute wrapped in brocade.
He took the flute and gave it to his son.</p>

<p>The bay of Suma is associated in the mind of a Japanese reader not
only with this battle but also with the stories of Prince Genji and
Prince Yukihira.</p>

<p>(See p. <a href="#Page_226">226</a>.)</p>

<p>I am one that serves Hōnen Shōnin of Kurodani; and as for this
child here,&mdash;once when Hōnen was on a visit to the Temple of Kamo
he saw a box lying under a trailing fir-tree; and when he raised the lid,
what should he find inside but a lovely man-child one year old! It
did not seem to be more than a common foundling, but my master
in his compassion took the infant home with him. Ever since then he
has had it in his care, doing all that was needful for it; and now the
boy is over ten years old.</p>

<p>But it is a hard thing to have no father or mother, so one day after
his preaching the Shōnin told the child’s story. And sure enough a
young woman stepped out from among the hearers and said it was her
child. And when he took her aside and questioned her, he found that
the child’s father was Taira no Atsumori, who had fallen in battle at
Ichi-no-Tani years ago. When the boy was told of this, he longed
earnestly to see his father’s face, were it but in a dream, and the Shōnin
bade him go and pray at the shrine of Kamo. He was to go every
day for a week, and this is the last day.</p>

<p>A strange voice spoke to me from within the Treasure Hall, saying,
“If you are wanting, though it were but in a dream, to see your father’s
face, go down from here to the woods of Ikuta in the country of
Settsu.” That is the marvellous dream I had.</p>

<p>It is indeed a wonderful message that the God has sent you. And
why should I go back at once to Kurodani? I had best take you

<p>I am Gyōkei, priest of the imperial temple Ninnaji. You must
know that there was a certain prince of the House of Taira named
Tsunemasa, Lord of Tajima, who since his boyhood has enjoyed beyond
all precedent the favour of our master the Emperor. But now he has
been killed at the Battle of the Western Seas.</p>

<p>It was to this Tsunemasa in his lifetime that the Emperor had given
the lute called Green Hill. And now my master bids me take it and
dedicate it to Buddha, performing a liturgy of flutes and strings for
the salvation of Tsunemasa’s soul. And that was my purpose in
gathering these musicians together.</p>

draw water from the same pool will be friends in another life. How

<p>These three plays deal with the boyhood of the hero Yoshitsune,
whose child-name was Ushiwaka.</p>

<p><i>Eboshi-ori</i> is a <i>genzai-mono</i>, that is to say a play which describes
events actually in progress. In <i>Kumasaka</i> these same events are rehearsed
by the ghost of one who participated in them. There are two
other well-known Yoshitsune plays, <i>Funa-Benkei</i> and <i>Ataka</i>. In the
former the phantoms of the dead Taira warriors attack the boat in
which Yoshitsune and Benkei are riding; in the latter occurs the famous
scene called the <i>Kwanjinchō</i>, in which Benkei pretends to read out from
a scroll a long document which he is in reality improvising on the spot.
(See Mr. Sansom’s translations of these two plays in the <i>Transactions
of the Asiatic Society of Japan</i>, 1911.) The <i>Kwanjinchō</i> was borrowed
by the popular stage, and became one of the favourite “turns” of the
great Danjūrō (1660-1703) and his successors.</p>

<p>There is no need to know his name. He is buried in that tomb over

<p>You must know that when I first took the vows of priesthood I went
round from village to village here, to Tarui, Auhaka and Akasaka&mdash;there
is no end to them, but I know all the roads,&mdash;through the tall
grass at Aono and the thick woods of Koyasu, night or day, rain or
fine. For I was a hill-bandit in those days, a thief of the night, tilting
baggage from mules’ backs; even stripping servant-girls of their
clothes, as they went from farm to farm, and leaving them sobbing.</p>

<p>Then it was that I used to take with me that pike there and waving
it in their faces, “Stand and deliver!” I would cry.</p>

<p>But at last a time came when it was not so.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> And after that time I
was glad enough to find shelter even in such a place as this. I yielded
my will and was content. For at last I had indeed resolved to leave
the hateful World.</p>

<p>That is a small thing to ask. Certainly we would take you with
us ..., but by the look of you, I fancy you must be an apprentice

<p>We have travelled so fast that we have already reached the Mirror

<p class="speaker">MESSENGER.</p>

<p>I am a servant in the Palace of Rokuhara. I have been sent to fetch
back young Ushiwaka, Lord Yoshitomo’s son, who has escaped from
the Temple of Kurama. It is thought that he has taken service with
the merchant Kichiji and has gone up-country with him; so they sent
me to bring him back. Why, I believe that is he! But perhaps he is
not alone. I cannot be sure. I had better go home and fetch help,
for if I were one against many, how could I hope to take him?</p>


<p class="speaker">USHIWAKA.</p>

<p>I think it is about me that this messenger is speaking. I must not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
let him know me. I will cut my hair and wear an <i>eboshi</i><a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>, so that
people may think I am an Eastern boy.</p>

<p class="speaker">HATMAKER.</p>

<p>Who is it?</p>


<p class="speaker">USHIWAKA.</p>

<p>I have come to order an <i>eboshi</i>.</p>


<p class="speaker">HATMAKER.</p>

<p>An <i>eboshi</i> at this time of night? I will make you one to-morrow, if
you like.</p>


<p class="speaker">USHIWAKA.</p>

<p>Please make it now. I am travelling in a hurry and cannot wait.</p>


<p class="speaker">HATMAKER.</p>

<p>Very well then; I will make it now. What size do you take?</p>


<p class="speaker">USHIWAKA.</p>

<p>Please give me an <i>eboshi</i> of the third size, folded to the left.</p>


<p class="speaker">HATMAKER.</p>

<p>I am afraid I cannot do that. They were worn folded to the left
in the time of the Minamotos. But now that the Tairas rule the whole
land it would not be possible to wear one folded so.</p>


<p class="speaker">USHIWAKA.</p>

<p>In spite of that I beg of you to make me one. There is a good
reason for my asking.</p>


<p class="speaker">HATMAKER.</p>

<p>Well, as you are so young there cannot be much harm in your wearing
it. I will make you one.</p>

<p>There is not an <i>eboshi</i> in the land that fits so well.</p>


<p class="speaker">USHIWAKA.</p>

<p>You are right; please take this sword in payment for it.</p>


<p class="speaker">HATMAKER.</p>

<p>No, no! I could not take it in return for such a trifle.</p>


<p class="speaker">USHIWAKA.</p>

<p>I beg you to accept it.</p>


<p class="speaker">HATMAKER.</p>

<p>Well, I cannot any longer refuse. How glad my wife will be!
(<i>Calling.</i>) Are you there?</p>


<p class="speaker">WIFE.</p>

<p>What is it? (<i>They go aside.</i>)</p>


<p class="speaker">HATMAKER.</p>

<p>This young lad asked me to make him an <i>eboshi</i>, and when it was
made he gave me this sword as a present. Is it not a noble payment?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Here, look at it. (<i>The wife takes the sword and when she has examined
it bursts into tears.</i>) Why, I thought you would treasure it like a gift
from Heaven. And here you are shedding tears over it! What is the
matter?</p>

<p class="speaker">WIFE.</p>

<p>Oh! I am ashamed. When I try to speak, tears come first and
choke the words. I am going to tell you something I have never told
you before. I am the sister of Kamada Masakiyo who fell at the
Battle of Utsumi in the country of Noma. At the time when Tokiwa
bore Ushiwaka, her third son, the lord her husband sent her this weapon
as a charm-sword, and I was the messenger whom he charged to carry
it. Oh were he in the world again;<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> then would our eyes no longer
behold such misery. Oh sorrow, sorrow!</p>


<p class="speaker">HATMAKER.</p>

<p>You say that you are the sister of Kamada Masakiyo?</p>


<p class="speaker">WIFE.</p>

<p>I am.</p>


<p class="speaker">HATMAKER.</p>

<p>How strange, how strange! I have lived with you all these years and
months, and never knew till now. But are you sure that you recognize
this weapon?</p>


<p class="speaker">WIFE.</p>

<p>Yes; this was the sword they called Konnentō.</p>


<p class="speaker">HATMAKER.</p>

<p>Ah! I have heard that name. Then this must be the young Lord
Ushiwaka from Kurama Temple. Come with me. We must go after
him and give him back the sword at once. Why, he is still there!
(<i>To</i> USHIWAKA.) Sir, this woman tells me she knows the sword;
I beg of you to take it back.</p>

<p class="speaker">USHIWAKA.</p>

<p>Lady Akoya?</p>


<p class="speaker">WIFE.</p>

<p>I am.</p>

<p class="speaker">HATMAKER and WIFE.</p>

<p>Oh! it breaks my heart to see him! A boy of noble name walking
barefoot with merchants, and nothing on his journey but cloth of
Shikama to clothe him. Oh! piteous sight!</p>


<p class="speaker">USHIWAKA.</p>

<p>Change rules the world for ever, and Man but for a little while.
What are fine clothes to me, what life itself while foemen flaunt?</p>


<p class="speaker">HATMAKER.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker">CHORUS.</p>

<p>So he spoke and pressed the sword into the young lord’s hands.
And the boy could not any longer refuse, but taking it said, “If ever
I come into the World<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> again, I will not forget.” And so saying he
turned and went on his way in company with the merchants his masters.
On they went till at last, weary with travel, they came to the Inn of
Akasaka in the country of Mino.</p>


<p class="speaker">KICHIJI (<i>the merchant</i>).</p>

<p>We have come so fast that here we are at the Inn of Akasaka.</p>

<p>Listen, Kichiroku, you had better take lodging for us here.</p>


<p class="speaker">KICHIROKU.</p>

<p>I obey. (<i>Goes towards the hashigakari or actors’ entrance-passage.</i>)
May I come in?</p>


<p class="speaker">INNKEEPER.</p>

<p>Who are you? Ah! it is Master Kichiroku. I am glad to see you
back again so soon.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>To</i> KICHIJI.)</p>

<p>Be on your guard, gentleman. For a desperate gang has got wind

<p class="speaker">KICHIJI.</p>

<p>What are we to do?</p>


<p class="speaker">KICHIROKU.</p>

<p>I cannot tell.</p>


<p>USHIWAKA (<i>comes forward</i>).</p>

<p>What are you speaking of?</p>


<p class="speaker">KICHIJI.</p>

<p>We have heard that robbers may be coming to-night. We were wondering
what we should do....</p>


<p class="speaker">USHIWAKA.</p>

<p>Let them come in what force they will; yet if one stout soldier go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
to meet them, they will not stand their ground, though they be fifty
mounted men.</p>


<p class="speaker">KICHIJI.</p>

<p>These are trusty words that you have spoken to us. One and all we

<p class="speaker">USHIWAKA.</p>

<p>Then arm yourselves and wait. I will go out to meet them.</p>


<p class="speaker">CHORUS.</p>

<p>And while he spoke, evening passed to darkness. “Now is the time,”
he cried, “to show the world those arts of war that for many months
and years upon the Mountain of Kurama I have rehearsed.”</p>

<p>Then he opened the double-doors and waited there for the slow in-coming
of the white waves.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>


<p class="speaker">BRIGANDS.</p>

<p>Loud the noise of assault. The lashing of white waves against the
rocks, even such is the din of our battle-cry.</p>


<p class="speaker">KUMASAKA.</p>

<p>Ho, my man! Who is there?</p>


<p class="speaker">BRIGAND.</p>

<p>I stand before you.</p>


<p class="speaker">KUMASAKA.</p>

<p>How fared those skirmishers I sent to make a sudden breach? Blew
wind briskly within?</p>


<p class="speaker">BRIGAND.</p>

<p>Briskly indeed; for some are slain and many grievously wounded.</p>


<p class="speaker">KUMASAKA.</p>

<p>How can that be? I thought that none were within but the merchants,
Kichiji and his brother. Who else is there?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker">BRIGAND.</p>

<p>By the light of a rocket<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> I saw a lad of twelve or thirteen years
slashing about him with a short-sword; and he was nimble as a butterfly
or bird.</p>


<p class="speaker">KUMASAKA.</p>

<p>And the brothers Surihari?</p>


<p class="speaker">BRIGAND.</p>

<p>Stood foster-fathers<a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> to the fire-throwers and were the first to enter.</p>

<p>But soon there meets them this child I tell of and with a blow at each
whisks off their heads from their necks.</p>


<p class="speaker">KUMASAKA.</p>

<p>Ei! Ei! Those two, and the horsemen that were near a hundred
strong,&mdash;all smitten! The fellow has bewitched them!</p>


<p class="speaker">BRIGAND.</p>

<p>When Takase saw this, thinking perhaps no good would come of
this night-attack, he took some seventy horsemen and galloped away
with them.</p>


<p class="speaker">KUMASAKA.</p>

<p>Ha! It is not the first time that lout has played me false.</p>

<p>How fared the torch-diviners?<a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>


<p class="speaker">BRIGAND.</p>

<p>The first torch was slashed in pieces; the second was trampled on till
it went out; the third they caught and threw back at us, but it too went
out. There are none left.</p>


<p class="speaker">KUMASAKA.</p>

<p>Then is all lost. For of these torch-diviners they sing that the first
torch is the soul of an army, the second torch is the wheel of Fate, and
the third torch&mdash;Life itself. All three are out, and there is no hope
left for this night’s brigandage.</p>


<p class="speaker">BRIGAND.</p>

<p>It is as you say. Though we were gods, we could not redeem our
plight. Deign to give the word of retreat.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker">KUMASAKA.</p>

<p>Why, even brigands must be spared from slaughter. Come, withdraw
my men.</p>


<p class="speaker">BRIGAND.</p>

<p>I obey.</p>


<p class="speaker">KUMASAKA.</p>

<p>Stay! Shall Kumasaka Chōhan be worsted in to-night’s affray?
Never! Where could he then hide his shame? Come, robbers, to the
attack!</p>


<p class="speaker">CHORUS.</p>

<p>So with mighty voice he called them to him, and they, raising their
war-cry, leapt to the assault.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Speaking for</i> USHIWAKA.)</p>

<p>“Hoho! What a to-do! Himself has come, undaunted by the fate
of those he sent before him. Now, Hachiman,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> look down upon me,
for no other help is here.” So he prayed, and stood waiting at the
gap.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Speaking for</i> KUMASAKA.)</p>

<p>“Sixty-three years has Kumasaka lived, and to-day shall make his
last night-assault.”<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> So he spoke and kicking off his iron-shoes in a
twinkling he levelled his great battle-sword that measured five foot
three, and as he leapt forward like a great bird pouncing on his prey,
no god or demon had dared encounter him.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Speaking for</i> USHIWAKA.)</p>

<p>“Ha, bandit! Be not so confident! These slinking night-assaults
displease me”; and leaving him no leisure, the boy dashed in to the
attack.</p>

<p>Then, Kumasaka, deeply versed in use of the battle-sword, lunged

<p class="speaker">BENKEI.</p>

<p>I am one who lives near the Western Pagoda. My name is Musashi-bō
Benkei. In fulfillment of a certain vow I have been going lately
by night at the hour of the Ox<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> to worship at the Gojō Temple. To-night
is the last time; I ought soon to be starting.</p>

<p>Hie! Is any one there?</p>


<p class="speaker">FOLLOWER.</p>

<p>Here I am.</p>


<p class="speaker">BENKEI.</p>

<p>I sent for you to tell you that I shall be going to the Gojō Temple
to-night.</p>


<p class="speaker">FOLLOWER.</p>

<p>I tremble and listen. But there is a matter that I must bring to your
notice. I hear that yesterday there was a boy of twelve or thirteen
guarding the Gojō Bridge. They say he was slashing round with his
short sword as nimble as a bird or butterfly. I beg that you will not
make your pilgrimage to-night. Do not court this peril.</p>


<p class="speaker">BENKEI.</p>

<p>That’s a strange thing to ask! Why, were he demon or hobgoblin,
he could not stand alone against many. We will surround him and
you shall soon see him on his knees.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker">FOLLOWER.</p>

<p>They have tried surrounding him, but he always escapes as though
by magic, and none is able to lay hands on him.</p>

<p>When he seems within their grasp</p>

Kagekiyo’s daughter. She has borne the toil of this journey because
she longed to meet her father face to face. Please take her to him.</p>


<p class="speaker">VILLAGER.</p>

<p>She is Kagekiyo’s daughter? How strange, how strange! But, lady,
calm yourself and listen.</p>

<p>Kagekiyo went blind in both his eyes, and finding himself helpless,
shaved his head and called himself the beggar of Hyūga. He begs a
little from travellers; and we villagers are sorry for him and see to it
that he does not starve. Perhaps he would not tell you his name
because he was ashamed of what he has become. But if you will
come with me I will shout “Kagekiyo” at him. He will surely
answer to his own name. Then you shall go to him and talk of what
you will, old times or now. Please come this way.</p>

<p>Silence! I was vexed already. For a while ago there came
travellers from my home! Do you think I let them stay? No, no.
I could not show them my loathsomeness.... It was hard to let

<p>I will tell him. (<i>To the</i> PRIEST.) I have given you lodging,
but I have not yet laid anything before you. It happens that we have
a little boiled millet. It is coarse food, but pray eat it if you can.</p>

<h4 class="break">NOTE ON KOMACHI.</h4>


<p>The legend of Komachi is that she had many lovers when she was
young but was cruel and mocked at their pain. Among them was one,
Shii no Shōshō, who came a long way to court her. She told him that
she would not listen to him till he had come on a hundred nights from
his house to hers and cut a hundred notches on the shaft-bench of his
chariot. And so he came a hundred nights all but one, through rain,
hail, snow, and wind. But on the last night he died.</p>

<p>Once, when she was growing old, the poet Yasuhide asked her to go
with him to Mikawa. She answered with the poem:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I that am lonely,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a reed root-cut,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should a stream entice me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would go, I think.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When she grew quite old, both her friends and her wits forsook her.
She wandered about in destitution, a tattered, crazy beggar-woman.</p>

<p>As is shown in this play, her madness was a “possession” by the
spirit of the lover whom she had tormented. She was released from
this “possession” by the virtue of a sacred Stūpa<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> or log carved into
five parts, symbolic of the Five Elements, on which she sat down to rest.</p>

<p>In the disputation between Komachi and the priests, she upholds the
doctrines of the Zen Sect, which uses neither scriptures nor idols; the
priests defend the doctrines of the Shingon Sect, which promises salvation
by the use of incantations and the worship of holy images.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>There is no doubt about the authorship of this play. Seami (<i>Works</i>,
p. 246) gives it as the work of his father, Kwanami Kiyotsugu.
Kwanami wrote another play, <i>Shii no Shōshō</i>,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> in which Shōshō is the
principal character and Komachi the <i>tsure</i> or subordinate.</p>

<p>Seami also used the Komachi legend. In his <i>Sekidera Komachi</i> he
tells how when she was very old the priests of <i>Sekidera</i> invited her to
dance at the festival of Tanabata. She dances, and in rehearsing the
splendours of her youth for a moment becomes young again.</p>

<p>Seami tells us (<i>Works</i>, p. 246) that this play was written by Enami
no Sayemon. “But as I removed bad passages and added good ones,
I consider the play to be really my work” (p. 247).</p>

<p>On p. 245 he points out that the same play on words occurs in <i>Ukai</i>
three times, and suggests how one passage might be amended. The
text of the play which we possess to-day still contains the passages
which Seami ridiculed, so that it must be Enami no Sayemon’s version
which has survived, while Seami’s amended text is lost.</p>

<p>It is well known that Buddhism forbids the taking of life, especially

lay down in the shelter of this shrine.</p>

<p class="speaker">SECOND PRIEST.</p>

<p>Listen. The sight of this man has brought back something to my
mind. Down this river there is a place they call Rock-tumble. And
there, when I passed that way three years ago, I met just such a
fisherman as this. And when I told him this cormorant-fishing was
reckoned a sin against life, I think he listened; for he brought me
back to his house and lodged me with uncommon care.</p>


<p class="speaker">FISHER.</p>

<p>And you are the priest that came then?</p>


<p class="speaker">SECOND PRIEST.</p>

<p>Yes, I am he.</p>

<p>Following his trade, more shame to him. Listen to his story and
give his soul your prayers.</p>

<p>Gladly we will.</p>


<p class="speaker">FISHER (<i>seats himself facing the audience and puts down his torch</i>).</p>

<p>You must know that on this river of Isawa, for a stretch of three
leagues up stream and down, the killing of any living creature is
forbidden. Now at that Rock-tumble you spoke of there were many
cormorant-fishers who every night went secretly to their fishing. And
the people of the place, hating the vile trade, made plans to catch
them at their task. But he knew nothing of this; and one night he
went there secretly and let his cormorants loose.</p>

<p>There was an ambush set for him; in a moment they were upon him.
“Kill him!” they cried; “one life for many,” was their plea. Then he
pressed palm to palm. “Is the taking of life forbidden in this place?
Had I but known it! But now, never again....” So with clasped
hands he prayed and wept; but none helped him; and as fishers set
their stakes they planted him deep in the stream. He cried, but no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>

<p>I am a courtier at the Palace of Kinomaru in the country of

so it happened that one day the old man who sweeps the garden here
caught sight of the Princess. And from that time he has loved her
with a love that gives his heart no rest.</p>

<p>Some one told her of this, and she said, “Love’s equal realm knows
no divisions,”<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> and in her pity she said, “By that pond there stands
a laurel-tree, and on its branches there hangs a drum. Let him beat
the drum, and if the sound is heard in the Palace, he shall see my
face again.”</p>

<p>I must tell him of this.</p>

<p>Listen, old Gardener! The worshipful lady has heard of your love
and sends you this message: “Go and beat the drum that hangs on

<h4><span class="smcap">Note on Aoi No Uye.</span></h4>


<p>At the age of twelve Prince Genji went through the ceremony of
marriage with Aoi no Uye (Princess Hollyhock), the Prime Minister’s
daughter. She continued to live at her father’s house and Genji at
his palace. When he was about sixteen he fell in love with Princess
Rokujō, the widow of the Emperor’s brother; she was about eight
years older than himself. He was not long faithful to her. The
lady Yūgao next engaged his affections. He carried her one night to
a deserted mansion on the outskirts of the City. “The night was far
advanced and they had both fallen asleep. Suddenly the figure of
a woman appeared at the bedside. “I have found you!” it cried.
“What stranger is this that lies beside you? What treachery is this
that you flaunt before my eyes?” And with these words the apparition
stooped over the bed, and made as though to drag away the
sleeping girl from Genji’s side.”<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>Before dawn Yūgao was dead, stricken by the “living phantom”
of Rokujō, embodiment of her baleful jealousy.</p>

<p>Soon after this, Genji became reconciled with his wife Aoi, but
continued to visit Rokujō. One day, at the Kamo Festival, Aoi’s
way was blocked by another carriage. She ordered her attendants
to drag it aside. A scuffle ensued between her servants and those
of Rokujō (for she was the occupant of the second carriage) in
which Aoi’s side prevailed. Rokujō’s carriage was broken and Aoi’s
pushed into the front place. After the festival was over Aoi returned
to the Prime Minister’s house in high spirits.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards she fell ill, and it is at this point that the play
begins.</p>

<p>There is nothing obscure or ambiguous in the situation. Fenollosa
seems to have misunderstood the play and read into it complications
and confusions which do not exist. He also changes the sex of the
Witch, though the Japanese word, <i>miko</i>, always has a feminine meaning.
The “Romance of Genji” (<i>Genji Monogatari</i>) was written by
Lady Murasaki Shikibu and was finished in the year 1004 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> Of
its fifty-four chapters only seventeen have been translated.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> It furnished
the plots of many Nō plays, of which <i>Suma Genji</i> (Genji’s exile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
at Suma), <i>No no Miya</i> (his visit to Rokujō after she became a nun),
<i>Tamakatsura</i> (the story of Yūgao’s daughter), and <i>Hajitomi</i> (in which
Yūgao’s ghost appears) are the best known.</p>

<p>There is some doubt about the authorship of the play. Seami saw
it acted as a Dengaku by his father’s contemporary Inūo. He describes
Inūo’s entry on to the stage in the rôle of Rokujō and quotes the
first six lines of her opening speech. These lines correspond exactly
with the modern text, and it is probable that the play existed in something
like its present form in the middle of the fourteenth century.
Kwanze Nagatoshi, the great-grandson of Seami, includes it in a list of
Seami’s works; while popular tradition ascribes it to Seami’s son-in-law
Zenchiku.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Note on Kantan.</span></h4>


<p>A young man, going into the world to make his fortune, stops at an
inn on the road and there meets with a sage, who lends him a pillow.
While the inn-servant is heating up the millet, the young man dozes on
the pillow and dreams that he enters public life, is promoted, degraded,
recalled to office, endures the hardship of distant campaigns,
is accused of treason, condemned to death, saved at the last moment
and finally dies at a great old age. Awaking from his dream, the
young man discovers that the millet is not yet cooked. In a moment’s
sleep he has lived through the vicissitudes of a long public career.
Convinced that in the great world “honour is soon followed by disgrace,
and promotion by calumny,” he turns back again towards the
village from which he came.</p>

<p>Such, in outline, is the most usual version of the story of Rosei’s
dream at Kantan. The earliest form in which we know it is the
“Pillow Tale” of the Chinese writer Li Pi, who lived from 722 to
789 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span></p>

<p>It is interesting to see how Seami deals with a subject which seems
at first sight so impossible to shape into a Nō play. The “sage” is
eliminated, and in the dream Rosei immediately becomes Emperor
of Central China. This affords an excuse for the Court dances which
form the central “ballet” of the piece. In the second half, as in <i>Hagoromo</i>
and other plays, the words are merely an accompaniment to the
dancing.</p>

<p>Chamberlain’s version loses by the fact that it is made from the
ordinary printed text which omits the prologue and all the speeches
of the hostess.</p>

<p>The play is usually attributed to Seami, but it is not mentioned in
his <i>Works</i>, nor in the list of plays by him drawn up by his great-grandson
in 1524.</p>

<p>It is discussed at considerable length in the <i>Later Kwadensho</i>, which
was printed <i>c.</i> 1600. The writer of that book must therefore have
regarded the play as a work of Seami’s period. It should be mentioned
that the geography of the play is absurd. Though both his
starting-point and goal lie in the south-western province of Ssechuan,
he passes through Hantan,<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> which lay in the northern province of
Chih-li.</p>

<p>I who now stand before you am a woman of the village of Kantan
in China. A long while ago I gave lodging to one who practised the
arts of wizardry; and as payment he left here a famous pillow, called
the Pillow of Kantan. He who sleeps on this pillow sees in a moment’s
dream the past or future spread out before him, and so awakes illumined.
If it should chance that any worshipful travellers arrive to-day,
pray send for me.</p>

(HŌKAZŌ)</h3>

<p class="speaker">MAKINO.</p>

<p>My name is Kojirō; I am the son of one Makino no Sayemon who
lived in the land of Shimotsuke. You must know that my father had
a quarrel with Nobutoshi, a man of Sagami, and was done to death by
him. So this man was my father’s murderer and I ought to kill him.
But he has many bold fellows to stand by him, while I am all alone.
So the days and months slip by with nothing done.</p>

<p>A brother indeed I have, but he left home when he was a child,
made himself into a priest, and lives at the seminary near by.</p>

<p>I am much puzzled how to act. I think I will go across and speak
to my brother of this matter. (<i>He goes to the curtain at the end of
the hashigakari.</i>) May I come in?</p>



<p class="center">(<i>The curtain is raised and the</i> BROTHER <i>appears</i>.)</p>


<p class="speaker">BROTHER.</p>

<p>Who is it?</p>


<p class="speaker">MAKINO.</p>

<p>It is I.</p>


<p class="speaker">BROTHER.</p>

<p>Come in, brother. What has brought you hither?</p>


<p class="speaker">MAKINO.</p>

<p>I will tell you. It is this matter of our father’s murder that has
brought me. I have been thinking that I ought to kill his enemy, and
would have done so but he has many bold fellows to stand by him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
and I am all alone. So the days and months slip by and nothing is
done.</p>

<p>For pity’s sake, decide with me what course we must pursue.</p>


<p class="speaker">BROTHER.</p>

<p>Brother, what you have said is true enough. But have you forgotten
that I left my home when I was but a child and made myself a priest?
Since that is so, I cannot help you.</p>


<p class="speaker">MAKINO.</p>

<p>So you are pleased to think; but men say he is a bad son who does
not kill his father’s foe.</p>


<p class="speaker">BROTHER.</p>

<p>Can you tell me of any that have ministered to piety by slaying a
parent’s foe?</p>


<p class="speaker">MAKINO.</p>

<p>Why, yes. It was in China, I think. There was one whose mother
had been taken by a savage tiger. “I will take vengeance,” he cried,
and for a hundred days he lay ambushed in the fields waiting for the
tiger to come. And once when he was walking on the hillside at
dusk, he thought he saw his enemy, and having an arrow already on
his bow-string, he shot with all his might. It was nothing but a great
rock that he had seen, shaped like a tiger. But his arrow stuck so
deep in the stone that blood gushed out from it. If then the strength
of piety is such that it can drive an arrow deep into the heart of a stone,
take thought, I beseech you, whether you will not resolve to come with
me.</p>


<p class="speaker">BROTHER.</p>

<p>You have cited me a notable instance. I am persuaded to resolve
with you how this thing may be effected.</p>

<p>Come now, by what strategy may we get access to our foe?</p>


<p class="speaker">MAKINO.</p>

<p>A plan has suddenly come into my head. You know that these <i>hōka</i>
plays are become the fashion of the day. Why should not I dress
up as a <i>hōka</i> and you as a <i>hōka</i> priest? They say that our man is a
great lover of the Zen doctrine; so you may talk to him of Zen.</p>

<p class="speaker">BROTHER.</p>

<p>What would you know?</p>


<p class="speaker">NOBUTOSHI.</p>

<p>It is this. They alone can be called priests round whose fingers
is twisted the rosary of Tenfold Power, who are clad in cloak of
Forbearance, round whose shoulders hangs the stole of Penitence.
Such is everywhere the garb of Buddha’s priests. I know no other
habit. But you, I see, carry a round fan tied to your pillar-staff. By
what verse do you justify the wearing of a fan?</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Note on Hagoromo.</span></h4>


<p>The story of the mortal who stole an angel’s cloak and so prevented
her return to heaven is very widely spread. It exists, with variations
and complications, in India, China, Japan, the Liu Chiu Islands and
Sweden. The story of Hasan in the <i>Arabian Nights</i> is an elaboration
of the same theme.</p>

<p>The Nō play is said to have been written by Seami, but a version
of it existed long before. The last half consists merely of chants
sung to the dancing. Some of these (e.g. the words to the Suruga
Dance) have no relevance to the play, which is chiefly a framework
or excuse for the dances. It is thus a Nō of the primitive type, and
perhaps belongs, at any rate in its conception, to an earlier period
than such unified dramas as <i>Atsumori</i> or <i>Kagekiyo</i>. The words of
the dances in <i>Maiguruma</i> are just as irrelevant to the play as those of
the Suruga Dance in <i>Hagoromo</i>, but there the plot explains and even
demands their intrusion.</p>

<p>The libretto of the second part lends itself very ill to translation,
but I have thought it best to give the play in full.</p>

<p>Now I have landed at the pine-wood of Mio and am viewing the

common things; nor is this beautiful cloak that hangs upon the pine-tree.

This surely is no common dress. I will take it back with me and show

<h4><span class="smcap">Note on Tanikō and Ikeniye.</span></h4>


<p>Both of these plays deal with the ruthless exactions of religion; in
each the first part lends itself better to translation than the second.
<i>Tanikō</i> is still played; but <i>Ikeniye</i>, though printed by both Ōwada
and Haga, has probably not been staged for many centuries.</p>

<p>The pilgrims of <i>Tanikō</i> are <i>Yamabushi</i>, “mountaineers,” to whom
reference has been made on page <a href="#Page_33">33</a>. They called themselves <i>Shu-genja</i>,
“portent-workers,” and claimed to be the knight-errants of
Buddhism. But their conduct seems to have differed little from that
of the <i>Sōhei</i> (armed monks) who poured down in hordes from Mount
Hiyei to terrorize the inhabitants of the surrounding country. Some
one in the <i>Genji Monogatari</i> is said to have “collected a crowd of
evil-looking Yamabushi, desperate, stick-at-nothing fellows.”</p>

<p><i>Ikeniye</i>, the title of the second play, means “Pool Sacrifice,” but
also “Living Sacrifice,” i.&nbsp;e. human sacrifice.</p>

<p>I am a teacher. I keep a school at one of the temples in the City.
I have a pupil whose father is dead; he has only his mother to look
after him. Now I will go and say good-bye to them, for I am soon
starting on a journey to the mountains. (<i>He knocks at the door of
the house.</i>) May I come in?</p>


<p class="speaker">BOY.</p>

<p>Who is it? Why, it is the Master who has come out to see us!</p>


<p class="speaker">TEACHER.</p>

<p>Why is it so long since you came to my classes at the temple?</p>


<p class="speaker">BOY.</p>

<p>I have not been able to come because my mother has been ill.</p>


<p class="speaker">TEACHER.</p>

<p>I had no idea of that. Please tell her at once that I am here.</p>

<p class="speaker">TEACHER.</p>

<p>It is a long time since I was here. Your son says you have been
ill. Are you better now?</p>


<p class="speaker">MOTHER.</p>

<p>Do not worry about my illness. It is of no consequence.</p>


<p class="speaker">TEACHER.</p>

<p>I am glad to hear it. I have come to say good-bye, for I am
soon starting on a ritual mountain-climbing.</p>


<p class="speaker">MOTHER.</p>

<p>A mountain-climbing? Yes, indeed; I have heard that it is a
dangerous ritual. Shall you take my child with you?</p>


<p class="speaker">TEACHER.</p>

<p>It is not a journey that a young child could make.</p>


<p class="speaker">MOTHER.</p>

<p>Well,&mdash;I hope you will come back safely.</p>


<p class="speaker">TEACHER.</p>

<p>I must go now.</p>

<p class="speaker">TEACHER.</p>

<p>What is it?</p>


<p class="speaker">BOY.</p>

<p>I will go with you to the mountains.</p>


<p class="speaker">TEACHER.</p>

<p>No, no. As I said to your mother, we are going on a difficult and
dangerous excursion. You could not possibly come with us. Besides,
how could you leave your mother when she is not well? Stay
here. It is in every way impossible that you should go with us.</p>


<p class="speaker">BOY.</p>

<p>Because my mother is ill I will go with you to pray for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>


<p class="speaker">TEACHER.</p>

<p>I must speak to your mother again. (<i>He goes back into the inner
room.</i>) I have come back,&mdash;your son says he is going to come with
us. I told him he could not leave you when you were ill and that it
would be a difficult and dangerous road. I said it was quite impossible
for him to come. But he says he must come to pray for your
health. What is to be done?</p>


<p class="speaker">MOTHER.</p>

<p>I have listened to your words. I do not doubt what the boy says,&mdash;that
he would gladly go with you to the mountains: (<i>to the</i> BOY)
but since the day your father left us I have had none but you at my
side. I have not had you out of mind or sight for as long a time as
it takes a dewdrop to dry! Give back the measure of my love. Let
your love keep you with me.</p>


<p class="speaker">BOY.</p>

<p>This is all as you say.... Yet nothing shall move me from my
purpose. I must climb this difficult path and pray for your health
in this life.</p>

<p>Stay! Such things may not be said by those who travel on errands

Lie there and rest.</p>

ask the Master about it.</p>

<p>Do so.</p>


<p class="speaker">LEADER.</p>

<p>I hear that this young boy is ill with climbing. What is the matter
with him? Are you anxious about him?</p>


<p class="speaker">TEACHER.</p>

<p>He is not feeling well, but there is nothing wrong with him. He is
only tired with climbing.</p>


<p class="speaker">LEADER.</p>

<p>So you are not troubled about him?</p>



<p class="center">(<i>A pause.</i>)</p>


<p class="speaker">PILGRIM.</p>

<p>Listen, you pilgrims. Just now the Master said this boy was only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
tired with climbing. But now he is looking very strange. Ought we
not to follow our Great Custom and hurl him into the valley?</p>


<p class="speaker">LEADER.</p>

<p>We ought to indeed. I must tell the Master. Sir, when I enquired
before about the child you told me he was only tired with climbing;
but now he is looking very strange.</p>

<p>Though I say it with dread, there has been from ancient times a
Great Custom that those who fail should be cast down. All the
pilgrims are asking that he should be thrown into the valley.</p>


<p class="speaker">TEACHER.</p>

<p>What, you would hurl this child into the valley?</p>


<p class="speaker">LEADER.</p>

<p>We would.</p>


<p class="speaker">TEACHER.</p>

<p>It is a Mighty Custom. I cannot gainsay it. But I have great
pity in my heart for that creature. I will tell him tenderly of this
Great Custom.</p>


<p class="speaker">LEADER.</p>

<p>Pray do so.</p>


<p class="speaker">TEACHER.</p>

<p>Listen carefully to me. It has been the law from ancient times that
if any pilgrim falls sick on such journey as these he should be
hurled into the valley,&mdash;done suddenly to death. If I could take your
place, how gladly I would die. But now I cannot help you.</p>

<p>I am a man who lives in the Capital. Maybe because of some

<p>Listen. I am sorry. There is something I must tell you privately.
Whoever passes this night at the Inn must go to-morrow to the draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>ing

<p>I hear that three travellers stayed at the Inn last night and have

<p>I listen and obey. Hey, you travellers, go no further!</p>

<p class="speaker">ACOLYTE.</p>

<p class="speaker">ACOLYTE.</p>

<p>He is right. It is not to be wondered at that he should ask the
reason. (<i>To the</i> TRAVELLER.) Listen. Each year at this place
there is a sacrifice at the Pool. To-day is the festival of this holy
rite, and we ask you to join in it.</p>


<p class="speaker">TRAVELLER.</p>

<p>I understand you. But it is for those that live here, those that
were born children of this Deity, to attend his worship. Must a
wanderer go with you because he chances to lodge here for a night?</p>

<p>No, No! For all you say, this will not do.</p>


<p class="speaker">PRIEST.</p>

<p>Stay! Sir, we do not wonder that you should think this strange.
But listen to me. From ancient times till now no traveller has ever
lodged this night of the year at the Inn of Yoshiwara without attending
the sacrifice at the Pool. If you are in a hurry, come quickly to
the sacrifice, and then with a blessing set out again on your journey.</p>


<p class="speaker">TRAVELLER.</p>

<p>I understand you. But, as I have said, for such rites as these you
should take men born in the place.... No, I still do not understand.
Why should a fleeting traveller be summoned to this Pool-Sacrifice?</p>


<p class="speaker">PRIEST.</p>

<p>It is a Great Custom.</p>


<p class="speaker">TRAVELLER.</p>

<p>That may be. I do not question that that is your rule. But I beg
you, consider my case and excuse me.</p>


<p class="speaker">PRIEST.</p>

<p>Would you be the first to break a Great Custom that has been
observed since ancient times?</p>


<p class="speaker">TRAVELLER.</p>

<p>No, that is not what I meant. But if we are to discuss this matter,
I must be plain with you.... I am a man of the Capital. Perhaps
because of some ill deed done in a former life I have suffered many
troubles. At last I could no longer build the pathway of my life,
so I took my wife and child and set out to seek my friend who lives
in the East. Pray let me go on my way.</p>

<h3 class="break">HAKU RAKUTEN</h3>

<p class="p2 center">By SEAMI</p>


<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

<p>The Chinese poet Po Chü-i, whom the Japanese call Haku Rakuten,
was born in 772 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> and died in 847. His works enjoyed immense
contemporary popularity in China, Korea and Japan. In the second
half of the ninth century the composition of Chinese verse became
fashionable at the Japanese Court, and native forms of poetry were
for a time threatened with extinction.</p>

<p>The Nō play <i>Haku Rakuten</i> deals with this literary peril. It was
written at the end of the fourteenth century, a time when Japanese art
and literature were again becoming subject to Chinese influence.
Painting and prose ultimately succumbed, but poetry was saved.</p>

<p>Historically, Haku Rakuten never came to Japan. But the danger
of his influence was real and actual, as may be deduced from reading
the works of Sugawara no Michizane, the greatest Japanese poet of
the ninth century. Michizane’s slavish imitations of Po Chü-i show
an unparalleled example of literary prostration. The plot of the
play is as follows:</p>

<p>Rakuten is sent by the Emperor of China to “subdue” Japan with
his art. On arriving at the coast of Bizen, he meets with two
Japanese fishermen. One of them is in reality the god of Japanese
poetry, Sumiyoshi no Kami. In the second act his identity is revealed.
He summons other gods, and a great dancing-scene ensues. Finally
the wind from their dancing-sleeves blows the Chinese poet’s ship
back to his own country.</p>

<p>Seami, in his plays, frequently quotes Po Chü-i’s poems; and in
his lament for the death of his son, Zemparu Motomasa, who died in
1432, he refers to the death of Po Chü-i’s son, A-ts’ui.</p>

<p>In China we play at making poetry.</p>


<p class="speaker">FISHERMAN.</p>

<p>And in Nihon, may it please you, we venture on the sport of
making “uta.”<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>


<p class="speaker">HAKU.</p>

<p>And what are “uta”?</p>


<p class="speaker">FISHERMAN.</p>

<p>You in China make your poems and odes out of the Scriptures of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
India; and we have made our “uta” out of the poems and odes of
China. Since then our poetry is a blend of three lands, we have
named it Yamato, the great Blend, and all our songs “Yamato Uta.”
But I think you question me only to mock an old man’s simplicity.</p>


<p class="speaker">HAKU.</p>

<p>No, truly; that was not my purpose. But come, I will sing a
Chinese poem about the scene before us.</p>

</div></div>

<p>How does that song please you?</p>

<p>Of the plays which are founded on the <i>Ise Monogatari</i><a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> the best
known are <i>Izutsu</i> and <i>Kakitsubata</i>, both by Seami. <i>Izutsu</i> is founded
on the episode which runs as follows:</p>

<p>Once upon a time a boy and a girl, children of country people,
used to meet at a well and play there together. When they grew up
they became a little shame-faced towards one another, but he could
think of no other woman, nor she of any other man. He would not
take the wife his parents had found for him, nor she the husband
that her parents had found for her.</p>

<p>Then he sent her a poem which said:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Oh, the well, the well!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I who scarce topped the well-frame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Am grown to manhood since we met.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And she to him:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The two strands of my hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That once with yours I measured,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have passed my shoulder;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who but you should put them up?”<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So they wrote, and at last their desire was fulfilled. Now after a year
or more had passed the girl’s parents died, and they were left without
sustenance. They could not go on living together; the man went to
and fro between her house and the town of Takayasu in Kawachi,
while she stayed at home.</p>

<p>Now when he saw that she let him go gladly and showed no grief
in her face, he thought it was because her heart had changed. And
one day, instead of going to Kawachi, he hid behind the hedge and
watched. Then he heard the girl singing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The mountain of Tatsuta that rises<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Steep as a wave of the sea when the wind blows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-night my lord will be crossing all alone!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And he was moved by her song, and went no more to Takayasu in
Kawachi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>In the play a wandering priest meets with a village girl, who turns
out to be the ghost of the girl in this story. The text is woven out of
the words of the <i>Ise Monogatari</i>.</p>

<div class="caption">IZUTSU</div>
</div>

<p><i>Kakitsubata</i> is based on the eighth episode. Narihira and his companions
come to a place called Yatsuhashi, where, across an iris-covered
swamp, zigzags a low footpath of planks.</p>

<p>Narihira bids them compose an anagram on the word <i>Kakitsubata</i>,
“iris,” and some one sings:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>Ka</i>ra-goromo<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ki</i>-tsutsu nare-ni-shi<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Tsu</i>ma shi areba<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ba</i>ru-baru ki-nuru<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ta</i>bi wo shi zo omou.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The first syllables of each line make, when read consecutively, the
word <i>Kakitsubata</i>, and the poem, which is a riddle with many meanings,
may be translated:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“My lady’s love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat close upon me like a coat well worn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And surely now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her thoughts go after me down this long road!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“When he had done singing, they all wept over their dried-rice till
it grew soppy.”</p>

<p>In the play, a priest comes to this place and learns its story from
a village-girl, who turns out to be the “soul of the iris-flower.” At
the end she disappears into the Western Paradise. “Even the souls
of flowers can attain to Buddhahood.”</p>

(THE FLOWER BASKET)</h3>

<p class="p2 center">By KWANAMI; REVISED BY SEAMI</p>


<p>Before he came to the throne, the Emperor Keitai<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> loved the Lady
Teruhi. On his accession he sent her a letter of farewell and a
basket of flowers. In the play the messenger meets her on the road
to her home; she reads the letter, which in elaborately ceremonial
language announces the Emperor’s accession and departure to the
Capital.</p>


<p class="speaker">TERUHI.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Spring of our love is passed! Like a moon left lonely<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the sky of dawn, back to the hills I go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the home where once we dwelt.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>She slips quietly from the stage, carrying the basket and letter.

in a litter borne by two attendants. It is the coronation
procession. Suddenly</i> TERUHI, <i>who has left her home distraught,
wanders on to the stage followed by her maid, who
carries the flower-basket and letter</i>.)</p></div>


<p class="speaker">TERUHI (<i>speaking wildly</i>).</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ho, you travellers! Show me the road to the Capital! I am mad, you say?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mad I may be; but love bids me ask. O heartless ones! why will they not answer me?<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p class="speaker">MAID.</p>

<p>Madam, from these creatures we shall get no answer. Yet there
is a sign that will guide our steps to the City. Look, yonder the
wild-geese are passing!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>
<p class="speaker">TERUHI.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh well-remembered! For southward ever<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wild-geese pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the empty autumn sky; and southward lies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The city of my lord.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then follows the “song of travel,” during which Teruhi and her
companion are supposed to be journeying from their home in Echizen
to the Capital in Yamato. They halt at last on the <i>hashigakari</i>,
announcing that they have “arrived at the City.” Just as a courtier
(who together with the boy-Emperor and the two litter-bearers represents
the whole coronation procession) is calling: “Clear the way,
clear the way! The Imperial procession is approaching,” Teruhi’s
maid advances on to the stage and crosses the path of the procession.
The courtier pushes her roughly back, and in doing so knocks the
flower-basket to the ground.</p>


<p class="speaker">MAID.</p>

<p>Oh, look what he has done! O madam, he has dashed your basket
to the ground, the Prince’s flower-basket!</p>


<p class="speaker">TERUHI.</p>

<p>What! My lord’s basket? He has dashed it to the ground? Oh
hateful deed!</p>


<p class="speaker">COURTIER.</p>

<p>Come, mad-woman! Why all this fuss about a basket? You call
it your lord’s basket; what lord can you mean?</p>


<p class="speaker">TERUHI.</p>

<p>What lord should I mean but the lord of this land of Sunrise? Is
there another?</p>

<p>Then follow a “mad dance” and song. The courtier orders her
to come nearer the Imperial litter and dance again, that her follies
may divert the Emperor.</p>

<p>She comes forward and dances the story of Wu Ti and Li Fu-jēn.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
Nothing could console him for her death. He ordered her portrait
to be painted on the walls of his palace. But, because the face
neither laughed nor grieved, the sight of it increased his sorrow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Many wizards laboured at his command to summon her soul before
him. At last one of them projected upon a screen some dim semblance
of her face and form. But when the Emperor would have touched
it, it vanished, and he stood in the palace alone.</p>


<p class="speaker">COURTIER.</p>

<p>His Majesty commands you to show him your flower-basket.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>She holds the basket before the</i> EMPEROR.)</p>


<p class="speaker">COURTIER.</p>

<p>His Majesty has deigned to look at this basket. He says that without
doubt it was a possession of his rural days.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> He bids you forget

<p>The play is written round a story and a poem. A man came to the
capital and was the lover of a woman there. Suddenly he vanished,
and she, in great distress, set out to look for him in the country he
came from. She found his house, and asked his servants where he
was. They told her he had just married and was with his wife.
When she heard this she ran out of the house and leapt into the Hōjō
River.</p>

<span class="i0">Was angry with him, for often when he touched it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It drooped and turned aside.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such is the story upon which the play is founded. The poem is one
by Bishop Henjō (816-890):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O lady-flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That preen yourselves upon the autumn hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even you that make so brave a show,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last but “one while.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Hito toki</i>, “one while,” is the refrain of the play. It was for “one
while” that they lived together in the Capital; it is for “one while”
that men are young, that flowers blossom, that love lasts. In the first
part of the play an aged man hovering round a clump of lady-flowers
begs the priest not to pluck them. In the second part this aged man
turns into the soul of the lover. The soul of the girl also appears,
and both are saved by the priest’s prayers from that limbo (half
death, half life) where all must linger who die in the coils of
<i>shūshin</i>, “heart-attachment.”</p>

<h3 class="break">MATSUKAZE</h3>

<p class="p2 center">By KWANAMI; REVISED BY SEAMI</p>


<p>Lord Yukihira, brother of Narihira, was banished to the lonely
shore of Suma. While he lived there he amused himself by helping
two fisher-girls to carry salt water from the sea to the salt-kilns on
the shore. Their names were Matsukaze and Murasame.</p>

<p>At this time he wrote two famous poems; the first, while he was
crossing the mountains on his way to Suma:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Through the traveller’s dress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The autumn wind blows with sudden chill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is the shore-wind of Suma<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blowing through the pass.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When he had lived a little while at Suma, he sent to the Capital a
poem which said:</p>

<p>Long afterwards Prince Genji was banished to the same place.
The chapter of the <i>Genji Monogatari</i> called “Suma” says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Although the sea was some way off, yet when the melancholy
autumn wind came “blowing through the pass” (the very wind of
Yukihira’s poem), the beating of the waves on the shore seemed near
indeed.</p></div>

<p>It is round these two poems and the prose passage quoted above
that the play is written.</p>

<p>A wandering priest comes to the shore of Suma and sees a
strange pine-tree standing alone. A “person of the place” (in an
interlude not printed in the usual texts) tells him that the tree
was planted in memory of two fisher-girls, Matsukaze, and Murasame,
and asks him to pray for them. While the priest prays it grows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
late and he announces that he intends to ask for shelter “in that
salt-kiln.” He goes to the “waki’s pillar” and waits there as if
waiting for the master of the kiln to return.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Matsukaze and Murasame come on to the stage and
perform the “water-carrying” dance which culminates in the famous
passage known as “The moon in the water-pails.”</p>


<p class="speaker">CHORUS (<i>speaking for</i> MURASAME).</p>

<p>There is a moon in my pail!</p>


<p class="speaker">MATSUKAZE.</p>

<p>Why, into my pail too a moon has crept!</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Looking up at the sky.</i>)</p>

<p>Their work is over and they approach their huts, i.&nbsp;e., the “<i>waki’s</i>
pillar,” where the priest is sitting waiting. After refusing for a long
while to admit him “because their hovel is too mean to receive him,”
they give him shelter, and after the usual questioning, reveal their
identities.</p>

<p>In the final ballet Matsukaze dresses in the “court-hat and hunting
cloak given her by Lord Yukihira” and dances, among other dances,
the “Broken Dance,” which also figures in Hagoromo.</p>

<p>The “motif” of this part of the play is another famous poem by
Yukihira, that by which he is represented in the <i>Hyakuninisshu</i> or
“Hundred Poems by a Hundred Poets”:</p>

Inaba, the name of a mountain, and <i>inaba</i>, “if I go away.”</p>

“heart-attachment,” which holds them to the earth.</p>

<p class="p2 center">By SEAMI</p>


<p>The priest Shunkwan, together with Naritsune and Yasuyori, had
plotted the overthrow of the Tairas. They were arrested and banished
to Devil’s Island on the shore of Satsuma.</p>

<p>Naritsune and Yasuyori were worshippers of the Gods of Kumano.
They brought this worship with them to the place of their exile,
constructing on the island an imitation of the road from Kyōto to
Kumano with its ninety-nine roadside shrines. This “holy way”
they decked with <i>nusa</i>, “paper-festoons,” and carried out, as best
they might, the Shintō ceremonies of the three shrines of Kumano.</p>

<p>When the play begins the two exiles are carrying out these rites.
Having no albs<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> to wear, they put on the tattered hemp-smocks
which they wore on their journey; having no rice to offer, they
pour out a libation of sand.</p>

<p>Shunkwan, who had been abbot of the Zen<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> temple Hosshōji, holds
aloof from these ceremonies. But when the worshippers return
he comes to meet them carrying a bucket of water, which he tells
them is the wine for their final libation. They look into the
bucket and cry in disgust: <i>Ya! Kore wa mizu nari!</i> “Why, it
is water!”</p>

<p>In a long lyrical dialogue which follows, Shunkwan, with the
aid of many classical allusions, justifies the identification of chrysanthemum-water
and wine.</p>

<p>Fujiwara no Fusazaki was the child of a fisher-girl. He was taken
from her in infancy and reared at the Capital. When he grew to
be a man he went to Shido to look for her. On the shore he met
with a fisher-girl who, after speaking for some while with him,
gave him a letter, and at once vanished with the words: “I am
the ghost of the fisher-girl that was your mother.” The letter said:</p>

blessing on your journey. I will not forget about the snow on the

speak. Do you suppose I would neglect him, however far away
you went?</p>


<p class="speaker">TONO-I.</p>

<p>No, indeed. I spoke of it, because he is so very young....</p>

<p class="speaker">SECOND WIFE.</p>

<p>Listen, Tsukiwaka! Your father has gone off on a pilgrimage.
Before he went, he said something to me about you. “Tend Tsukiwaka
with care,” he said. There was no need for him to speak. You must
have been telling him tales about me, saying I was not kind to
you or the like of that. You are a bad boy. I am angry with you,
very angry! (<i>She turns away.</i>)</p>

<h3 class="break">TANGO-MONOGURUI</h3>

<p class="p2 center">By I-AMI</p>


<p>There are several plays which describe the fatal anger of a father
on discovering that his child has no aptitude for learning. One
of these, <i>Nakamitsu or Manjū</i>, has been translated by Chamberlain.
The <i>Tango-Monogurui</i>, a similar play, has usually been ascribed to
Seami, but Seami in his <i>Works</i> says that it is by a certain I-ami. The
father comes on to the stage and, after the usual opening, announces
that he has sent a messenger to fetch his son, whom he has put
to school at a neighbouring temple. He wishes to see what progress
the boy is making.</p>


<p class="speaker">FATHER (<i>to his</i> SERVANT).</p>

<p>I sent some one to bring Master Hanamatsu back from the temple.
Has he come yet?</p>


<p class="speaker">SERVANT.</p>

<p>Yes, sir. He was here last night.</p>


<p class="speaker">FATHER.</p>

<p>What? He came home last night, and I heard nothing about it?</p>


<p class="speaker">SERVANT.</p>

<p>Last night he had drunk a little too much, so we thought it better
not to say that he was here.</p>


<p class="speaker">FATHER.</p>

<p>Oho! Last night he was tipsy, was he? Send him to me.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>The</i> SERVANT <i>brings</i> HANAMATSU.)</p>

<p>Well, you have grown up mightily since I saw you last.</p>

<p>I sent for you to find out how your studies are progressing. How
far have you got?</p>


<p class="speaker">HANAMATSU.</p>

<p>I have not learnt much of the difficult subjects. Nothing worth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
mentioning of the Sūtras or Shāstras or moral books. I know a
little of the graduses and Eight Collections of Poetry; but in the
Hokke Scripture I have not got to the Law-Master Chapter, and in
the Gusha-shāstra I have not got as far as the Seventh Book.</p>


<p class="speaker">FATHER.</p>

<p>This is unthinkable! He says he has not learnt anything worth
mentioning. Pray, have you talents in any direction?</p>


<p class="speaker">SERVANT (<i>wishing to put in a good word for the boy</i>).</p>

<p>Be quiet! Is it your child I was talking of?</p>


<p class="speaker">SERVANT.</p>

<p>No, sir, you were speaking of Master Hanamatsu.</p>


<p class="speaker">FATHER.</p>

<p>Now then, Hanamatsu. Is this true? Very well then; just listen
quietly to me. These childish tricks&mdash;writing odes, capping verses
and the like are not worth anything. They’re no more important than
playing ball or shooting toy darts. And as for the chop-sticks and
drum&mdash;they are the sort of instruments street urchins play on under
the Spear<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> at festival-time. But when I ask about your studies, you
tell me that in the Hokke you have not got to the Law-Master Chapter,
and in the Gusha-shāstra you have not reached the Seventh Book. Might
not the time you spent on the chop-sticks have been better employed
in studying the Seventh Book? Now then, don’t excuse yourself!
Those who talk most do least. But henceforth you are no son of
mine. Be off with you now!</p>

<p class="center">(<i>The boy hesitates, bewildered.</i>)</p>

<p>Well, if you can’t get started by yourself I must help you.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Seizes him by the arm and thrusts him off the stage.</i>)</p>

<p>In the next scene Hanamatsu enters accompanied by a pious ship’s
captain, who relates that he found the lad on the point of drowning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
himself, but rescued him, and, taking him home, instructed him in
the most recondite branches of knowledge, for which he showed
uncommon aptitude; now he is taking him back to Tango to reconcile
him with his father.</p>

<p>At Tango they learn that the father, stricken with remorse, has
become demented and is wandering over the country in search of his
son.</p>

<p>Coming to a chapel of Manjushrī, the captain persuades the lad
to read a service there, and announces to the people that an eminent
and learned divine is about to expound the scriptures. Among the
worshippers comes an eccentric character whom the captain is at
first unwilling to admit.</p>

(THE ONE-HORNED RISHI)</h3>


<p>A Rishi lived in the hills near Benares. Under strange circumstances<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>
a roe bore him a son whose form was human, save that a single
horn grew on his forehead, and that he had stag’s hoofs instead of
feet. He was given the name <i>Ekashringa</i>, “One-horn.”</p>

<p>One day it was raining in the hills. Ekashringa slipped and hurt
himself, for his hoofs were ill-suited to his human frame. He cursed
the rain, and owing to his great merit and piety his prayer was
answered. No rain fell for many months.</p>

<p>The King of Benares saw that the drought would soon bring
famine. He called together his counsellors, and one of them told
him the cause of the disaster. The King published a proclamation
promising half of his kingdom to any who could break the Rishi’s
spell. Then the harlot Shāntā came to the King and said, “I will
bring you this Rishi riding him pickaback!”</p>

<p>She set out for the mountains, carrying fruit and wine. Having
seduced the Rishi, she persuaded him to follow her to Benares. Just
outside the town she lay down, saying that she was too tired to go a
step further. “Then I will carry you pickaback,” said the Rishi.</p>

<p>And so Shāntā fulfilled her promise.</p>


<p class="tbpara">In the Nō play (which is by Komparu Zembō Motoyasu 1453-1532)
the Rishi has overpowered the Rain-dragons, and shut them
up in a cave. Shāntā, a noble lady of Benares, is sent to tempt him.
The Rishi yields to her and loses his magic power. There comes a

UJINOBU FROM AN ORIGINAL BY
SEAMI</p>


<p>Yamauba is the fairy of the mountains, which have been under
her care since the world began. She decks them with snow in winter,
with blossoms in spring; her task carrying her eternally from hill to
valley and valley to hill. She has grown very old. Wild white
hair hangs down her shoulders; her face is very thin.</p>

<p>There was a courtesan of the Capital who made a dance representing
the wanderings of Yamauba. It had such success that people
called this courtesan “Yamauba” though her real name was Hyakuma.</p>

<p>Once when Hyakuma was travelling across the hills to Shinano to
visit the Zenkō Temple, she lost her way, and took refuge in the
hut of a “mountain-girl,” who was none other than the real Yamauba.</p>

<p>In the second part of the play the aged fairy appears in her true
form and tells the story of her eternal wanderings&mdash;“round and
round, on and on, from hill to hill, from valley to valley.” In
spring decking the twigs with blossom, in autumn clothing the hills
with moonlight, in winter shaking snow from the heavy clouds. “On
and on, round and round, caught in the Wheel of Fate.... Striding
to the hill-tops, sweeping through the valleys....”</p>

<p>Giō was the mistress of Kiyomori (1118-1181), the greatest of the
Tairas. One day there arrived at his camp a famous dancing-girl
called Hotoke. Kiyomori was for sending her away; but Giō, who had
heard wonderful stories of Hotoke’s beauty, was anxious to see her,
and persuaded Kiyomori to let Hotoke dance before him.</p>

<p>Kiyomori fell in love with the dancer, and after a while Giō was
dismissed. She became a nun, and with her mother and sister lived in
a hut in the wilds of Sagano.</p>

<p>Hotoke, full of remorse at her rival’s dismissal, found no pleasure
in her new honours, and saying “It was I who brought her to this,”
fled in nun’s clothing to the hut at Sagano. Here the four women
lived together, singing ceaseless prayers to Buddha.</p>

<p>In the play the ghost of Hotoke appears to a “travelling priest” and
tells the story, which is indeed a curious and arresting one.</p>

(THE FOOTBALL)</h3>


<p>A footballer died at the Capital. When the news was brought to
his wife, she became demented and performed a sort of football-mass
for his soul. “The eight players in a game of football,” she declared,
“represent the eight chapters in the Hokke Scripture. If
the four goal-posts are added the number obtained is twelve, which
is the number of the Causes and Effects which govern life. Do not
think of football as a secular game.”</p>

<p>The play ends with a “football ballet.”</p>

<p>The <i>Journal</i> of the great twelfth century footballer, Fujiwara no
Narimichi, contains the following story: “I had brought together
the best players of the time to assist me in celebrating the completion of
my thousandth game. We set up two altars, and upon the one we
placed our footballs, while on the other we arranged all kinds of
offerings. Then, holding on to prayer-ribbons which we had tied
to them, we worshipped the footballs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>That night I was sitting at home near the lamp, grinding my ink
with the intention of recording the day’s proceedings in my journal,
when suddenly the football which I had dedicated came bouncing
into the room followed by three children of about four years old.
Their faces were human, but otherwise they looked like monkeys.
“What horrid creatures,” I thought, and asked them roughly who they
were.</p>

<p>“We are the Football Sprites,” they said. “And if you want to know
our names&mdash;” So saying they lifted their hanging locks, and I
saw that each of them had his name written on his forehead, as
follows: Spring Willow Flower, Quiet Summer Wood, and Autumn
Garden. Then they said, “Pray remember our names and deign to
become our <i>Mi-mori</i>, ‘Honourable Guardian.’ Your success at <i>Mi-mari</i>,
‘Honourable Football,’ will then continually increase.”</p>

<p>And so saying they disappeared.”</p>

Labourers toiled up from the sea-shore, which was many miles
distant, carrying pails of salt water.</p>

<p>In the play a priest passing through Rokujō-kawara meets an old

(THE DANCE WAGGONS)</h3>

<p class="p2 center">By MIYAMASU (DATE UNKNOWN)</p>


<p>A man of Kamakura went for a year to the Capital and fell in love
with a girl there. When it was time for him to return to Kamakura
he took her with him. But his parents did not like her, and one
day when he was not at home, they turned her out of the house.</p>

<p>Thinking that she would have gone towards the Capital, the man
set out in pursuit of her. At dusk he came to a village. He was
told that if he lodged there he must take part next day in the waggon-dancing,
which was held in the sixth month of each year in honour of
the god Gion. He told them that he was heart-sore and foot-sore, and
could not dance.</p>

<p>Next day the villagers formed into two parties. The first party
mounted the waggon and danced the <i>Bijinzoroye</i>, a ballad about the
twelve ladies whom Narihira loved. The second party danced the
ballad called <i>Tsumado</i>, the story of which is:</p>

<p>Hosshō, Abbot of the Hiyeizan, was sitting late one summer night
by the Window of the Nine Perceptions, near the Couch of the
Ten Vehicles, in a room sprinkled with the holy water of Yoga,
washed by the moonlight of the Three Mysteries. Suddenly there
was a sound of hammering on the double-doors. And when he
opened the doors and looked&mdash;why, there stood the Chancellor Kwan,
who had died on the twenty-fifth day of the second month.</p>

<p>“Why have you come so late in the night, Chancellor Kwan?”</p>

<p>“When I lived in the world foul tongues slandered me. I am
come to destroy my enemies with thunder. Only the Home of

will not harm you. Swear that you will go no more to Court!”</p>

<p>“I would not go, though they sent twice to fetch me. But if they
sent a third time ...”</p>

<p>Then Chancellor Kwan, with a strange look on his face, drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
a pomegranate from his sleeve, put it between his lips, crunched it
with his teeth, and spat it at the double-doors.</p>

<p>Suddenly the red pomegranate turned into fire; a great flame
flickered over the double-doors.</p>

<p>When the Abbot saw it, he twisted his fingers into the Gesture
of Libation; he recited the Water-Spell of the Letter Vam, and the
flames died down.</p>

<p>And the double-doors still stand before the Abbot’s cell, on the
Hill of Hiyei.</p>

<p>When the two dances were over, the master of ceremonies called
for a dance from one of those who had been watching. A girl
stepped forward and said she would dance the “Dance of Tora Parting
from Sukenari.” Then they called across to the man who had
lost his wife (he was over by the other waggon). “Come, you
must dance now.” “Forgive me, I cannot dance.” “Indeed you
must dance.” “Then I will dance the ‘Dance of Tora Parting from
Sukenari.’”</p>

<p>“But this dance,” said the master of ceremonies, “is to be danced
by a girl on the other side. You must think of another dance.”</p>


<p class="speaker">MAN.</p>

<p>I know no other dance.</p>


<p class="speaker">MASTER OF CEREMONIES.</p>

<p>Here’s a pretty fix! Ha, I have it! Let’s set the waggons side
by side, and the two of them shall dance their dance together.</p>

<p>When they step up on to the waggons, the man finds that his
partner is the wife he was seeking for. They begin to dance the
“Dance of Tora,” but soon break off to exchange happy greetings.
The plays ends with a great ballet of rejoicing.</p>


<p class="tbpara">There is one whole group of plays to which I have hitherto made no
reference: those in which a mother seeks for her lost child. Mrs.
Stopes has translated <i>Sumidagawa</i>, and Mr. Sansom, <i>Sakuragawa</i>.
Another well-known play of this kind is <i>Miidera</i>, a description of
which will be found in an appendix at the end of this book (p. <a href="#Page_267">267</a>).</p>

<p class="tbpara">A few other plays, such as <i>Nishikigi</i>, <i>Motomezuka</i>, and <i>Kinuta</i>, I
have omitted for lack of space and because it did not seem to me that
I could in any important way improve on existing versions of them.</p>

<p>Well, what is it?</p>

<p>It’s like this. The sinner says that on the Terrestrial Plane he was
a well-known bird-catcher. Now that means taking life all the time;
it’s a serious matter, and he certainly ought to go to Hell. But
when we told him so, he said we’d entirely misjudged him.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX I</h2>

<h3>MODERN NŌ LETTERS FROM JAPAN</h3>


<p>The fact that Nō did not disappear with the overthrow of the Shogun
in 1863 was almost solely due to the efforts of Umewaka Minoru
(1828-1909), whose ancestors had for generations played <i>tsure</i> parts
in the Kwanze theatre. When the Mikado was restored in 1868
Kiyotaka, head of the Kwanze line, was convinced that an art
so intimately connected with the Shōgunate must perish with it, and
fled to Shizuoka where the fallen Shōgun was living in retreat.</p>

<p>Minoru alone remained behind, built himself a theatre<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> (1869-70)
and “manned his lonely rampart.” When confidence was re-established
the other “troupes” soon returned, so that henceforward five
theatres existed, the four of earlier days and that of Umewaka as a
fifth. Minoru was succeeded by his brilliant sons, Mansaburō and
Rokurō, who in 1919 opened a new Umewaka theatre. As a compliment
to the Umewaka family and a tribute to its services, actors of
the three other “schools” took part in the opening ceremony, but
the Kwanzes refused to do so. The dispute turns on the right to
grant certificates of efficiency (<i>menjō</i>) which, according to the Kwanzes’
claim, belongs only to Motoshige, the head of their school. Such
certificates have, in fact, been issued successively by Minoru, his
sons and the “renegade” Kwanze Tetsunojō, who sides with the
Umewaka. The validity of Minoru’s certificates was, I believe, never
disputed during his lifetime.</p>

<p>To complete this note on modern Nō I include the following extracts
from letters written in 1916 by Mr. Oswald Sickert to Mr. Charles
Ricketts. The sender and recipient of the letters both authorized me
to use them, and for this permission I am deeply grateful. But I
wish that Mr. Sickert, whose memories of Nō must already be a
little dimmed, had had the leisure to write a book of his own on the
two dramatic arts that so deeply interested him in Japan, the Nō and
the Kabuki.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It’s odd if people describe the Nō performance as a thing that
is simple or unsophisticated or unelaborated. The poem, to begin with,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
is not simple, but it has a lyrical slenderness which wouldn’t
one would say, lead anybody to think of going such lengths as to distribute
its recitation among a chorus and actors, thus requiring perhaps
eleven men to say the words, with two or three drums and a flute
added, and masks and costumes fit for a museum and angelic properties,
and special stages, and attendants to wipe, in this hot weather,
the sweat from immovable hands and from under chins. The volume
of what goes to a performance is large, but it’s all cut down outwardly
and bent inwards. As for the recitation, the first necessity
is to eliminate direct expressiveness in the saying of the words. This
seems obvious in the saying of any good poetry. The chorus chants
(it’s rather like a Gregorian chant), the actors intone. Both may
come to singing, only not with any tune that might carry you off by
itself. Yet, within the limitations of intoning, with some turns, the
actor taking the women’s parts will achieve a pitch of pathetic intensity
beyond the reach of one who sings words to an air that has
an existence of its own, or who recites with meaning. The Nō actor
is not directly expressive, it’s always the poem he is doing and
throwing you back on.</p>

<p>“I suppose the mask may have originated in a priest’s needing
to impersonate an angel or a beautiful girl, or an evil spirit; but
its justification, as against make-up, is absolute for the Nō purpose.
I saw in the same week <i>Funa Benkei</i>, adapted for the theatre, at the
Imperial and on a Nō stage. At the theatre, the part of Shizuka, the
mistress whom Yoshitsune the pursued young lord is persuaded to
send away, was taken by Baikō. It was one of his nights, and all
the evening, as three different women and a ghost, he was so that
I shall not again ever so much care about a beautiful woman taken
by a beautiful woman. But in the theatre version of <i>Funa Benkei</i>,
Shizuka wore no mask, and when she pleaded, Baikō, of course, acted;
it was charming; but Heaven knows what <i>words</i> he was saying&mdash;certainly
he was not turning the mind of his audience in upon any
masterpiece of words, rhythm and poetical fancy. He was acting
the situation. The Nō performer, on the other hand, is intensifying
the poet’s fancy. From sight of the masks hung up alone, I had
not imagined how well their mixture of vacancy and realism would
do the trick. The masks are not wayward, not extravagant (even
the devil’s masks are realistic); but they are undoubtedly masks tied
on with a band, and they effect the purpose of achieving an impassive
countenance of a cast suited to the character&mdash;impassive save that,
with a good actor and a mask of a beautiful woman that just hits
off the balance between too much and too little physiognomy, I’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
swear that at the right moments the mask is affected, its expression
intensifies, it lives.</p>

<p>“The costumes are tremendous, elaborate, often priceless heirlooms;
but again they are not extravagant, ‘on their own,’ being all distinctly
hieratic (as indeed is the whole performance, a feature historically
deriving, maybe, from its original source among priests, but just
what one would desiderate if one were creating a Nō performance
out of the blue), because the hieratic helps to create and maintain a
host of restrictions and conventions which good taste alone, even
in Japan, could scarcely have preserved against the fatal erosion
of reason.</p>

<p>“The masked actors of beautiful women are stuffed out and by
some device increase the appearance of height, though all go in
socks and apparently with bent knees. The great masked figure, gliding
without lifting the heels, but with all the more appearance of swiftness,
to the front of the stage, is the most ecstatic thing to sit under,
and the most that a man can do to act what people mean by ‘poetical,’
something removed from reality but not remote, fascinating so that
you fall in love with it, but more than you would care to trifle with.
This movement occurs in the dances which come in some plays&mdash;I
think always as dances by characters invited to dance&mdash;and which
are the best moments for the stranger, since then alone does the
rhythm of the drums become regular enough for him to recognize it.
For that is really, I am sure, the bottom essential of the Nō representation&mdash;the
rhythm marked by two drums. For quite long intervals
nothing else occurs. No actor is on the stage, no word is uttered,
but the sharp rap sounds with the thimbled finger as on a box and
the stumpy little thud of the bare hands follows, or coincides, from
the second drum and both players give a crooning whoop. In some
way, which I can’t catch, that rhythm surely plays into the measure
of the recitation when it comes and into the movements of the actors
when they come. You know how people everywhere will persist in
justifying the admirable in an art on the ground of the beautiful
ideas it presents. So my friends tell me the drum beats suggest the
travelling of the pilgrim who is often the hinge of the episode. I
feel like a Japanese who wants to know whether a sonnet has any
particular number of lines, and any order for its rhymes and repeats,
and gets disquisitions on Shakespeare’s fancy which might also apply
to a speech in blank verse. Anyway, it is ever so evident that the
musicians do something extremely difficult and tricky. The same
musicians don’t seem to play on through the three pieces which make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
a programme. As they have no book (and don’t even look at each
other), they must know the performance by heart, and the stranger’s
attention is often called by a friend to one or the other who is specially
famous for his skill. Some one tried to explain the relation between
the musicians and the actors by saying that a perpetual sort of
contest went on between them. Certainly there seems to be in a Nō
performance some common goal which has to be strained for every
time, immensely practised though the performers are. During the
dance this drum rhythm speeds up to a felt time, and at moments
of great stress, as when an avenging ghost swims on with a spear,
a third drum, played with sticks, comes in with rapid regular beats,
louder and softer. Sometimes when the beats are not so followable,
but anyway quicker in succession, I seem to make out that they must
be involving themselves in some business of syncopation, or the catching
up and outstripping of a slow beat by a quicker one. But
the ordinary beats are too far apart for me to feel any rhythm yet.</p>

<p>“The best single moment I have seen was the dance of thanks
to the fisherman who returns to the divine lady the Hagoromo, the
robe without which even an angel cannot fly. It seemed to me an
example of the excellent rule in art that, if a right thing is perhaps
rather dull or monotonous lasting five minutes, you will not cure the
defect by cutting the performance to two and a half minutes; rather
give it ten minutes. If it’s still perhaps rather dull, try twenty minutes
or an hour. This presupposes that your limitations are right and that
you <i>are</i> exploiting them. The thing may seem dull at first because
at first it is the limitations the spectator feels; but the more these
are exploited the less they are felt to be limitations, and the more
they become a medium. The divine lady returned on her steps
at great length and fully six times after I had thought I could not bear
it another moment. She went on for twenty minutes, perhaps, or an
hour or a night; I lost count of time; but I shall not recover from
the longing she left when at last she floated backwards and under
the fatal uplifted curtain. The movements, even in the dance, are
very restricted if one tries to describe or relate them, but it may be
true, as they say, that the Nō actor works at an intense and concentrated
pitch of all his thoughts and energies, and this tells through
his impassive face or mask and all his clothes and his slow movements.
Certainly the longer I looked at the divine lady, the more she seemed
to me to be in action, though sometimes the action, if indeed there,
was so slight that it could be that she had worked us up to the fine
edge of noticing her breathing. There was only one memorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
quick motion in the dance, the throwing of the stiff deep gauze
sleeve over the head, over the crown with its lotus and bell tassels.
My wife has no inclination to deceive herself with the fascination of
what she can’t explain, and she agreed that this was the most beautiful
thing that had ever been seen.</p>

<p>“You will see the two drum players in many of the cards. With
them sits the player on the fue, a transverse flute, who joins in at
moments with what often is, if you take it down, the same phrase,
though it sounds varied as the player is not often exactly on any note
that you <i>can</i> take down. The dropping of the flute’s note at the
end of the phrase, which before always went up, is the nearest approach
to the ‘curtain’ of the theatre. It is very touching. The
poem has come to an end. The figures turn and walk off....</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have been to more Nō performances, always with increasing
recognition of the importance attaching to the beat, a subject on
which I have got some assurance from an expert kindly directed to
me by a friend. From beginning to end, all the words of every Nō
play fit into an 8-beat measure, and a performer who sat in the
dark, tapping the measure while skilfully weaving in the words,
would give a Nō audience the essential ground of its pleasure. If
they are not actually being followed on books, in which they are
printed as ticks alongside the text, the beats are going on inside
(often to the finger tips of) all the people whom I notice to be
regular attendants at Nō performances. I saw a play (not a good
one) at the Kabukiza in which a Nō master refuses a pupil a
secret in his art. For some reason the pupil attaches importance
to being shown the way in this difficult point. The master’s daughter
takes poison and, in fulfilment of her dying request, the master
consents to show the pupil. It was no subtlety of gesture, no matter
of voice or mask, that brought things to such straits. The master
knelt at his desk, and, beating with his fan, began reciting a passage,
showing how the words were distributed in the beat.</p>

<p>“It is very seldom that every beat in the eight is marked by a
drum. I don’t think this happens save in those plays where the
taiko (the real drum played with sticks) takes part, generally in an
important or agitated dance. In the ordinary course, only certain
of the eight beats are marked by the two players on the tsuzumi
(one held on the knee, the other over the shoulder). The Japanese
get much more out of subtleties of rhythm (or, rather, out of playing
hide-and-seek with one simple rhythm) than we do and are corre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>spondingly
lax about the interval between one note and another. I
don’t believe a European would have thought of dividing the drum
beats between two instruments. It must be horribly tricky to do.
This division gives variety, for the big tsuzumi yields a clack and
the small yields something between a whop and a thud.</p>

<p>“As for masks, one would have to see very many performances, I
fancy, and think a lot, before one got on to any philosophy of their
fascination and effectiveness. I am always impressed by the realism,
the naturalness of the Nō mask. It is not fanciful in any obvious
sense. After a few performances, I found I knew when a mask was a
particularly good one. My preferences turned out to be precious
heirlooms two hundred years old. In one instance when, for a reason
I don’t yet understand, Rokurō changed his mask after death for
another of the same cast, I could not say why the first was better than
the second&mdash;certainly not for a pleasanter surface, for it was shining
like lacquer; I noticed the features were more pronounced. We were
allowed the thrill of being let into the room of the mirror, immediately
behind the curtain, and saw Rokurō have his mask fitted
and make his entry after a last touch by his brother Mansaburō.
These brothers are Umewaka, belong to the Kwanze School, and have
a stage of their own. I am told that my preference for them is
natural to a beginner and that later one likes as much, or better,
the more masculine style of the Hōshō. At present Nagashi (Matsumoto),
the chief performer of this school (which has a lovely
stage and a very aristocratic clientèle), seems to me like an upright
gentleman who has learned his lesson, while Rokurō and Mansaburō
are actors. Both brothers have beautiful voices. The Hōshō people
speak with a thickness in the throat. But I know it is absurd for
me to feel critical about anything. Moreover, Rokurō and Nagashi
would not take the same parts.</p>

<p>“MIIDERA. A mother, crazed by the straying away of her little
boy, is advised by a neighbour any way to go to Ōtsu, for there stands
the temple of Mii which she had seen in a dream.</p>

<p>“The priests of Miidera, with the little boy among them, are
out in the temple yard viewing the full autumn moon. The attendant
tolls the great bell, whose lovely note wavers long over the lake
below. The mad mother appears on the scene, and, drawn to the
bell, makes to toll it. The head priest forbids her. There follows an
argument full of bell lore, and its effect on troubled hearts. She
tolls the bell, and mother and son recognize each other.</p>

<p>“One of the cards I sent shows the mother tolling the bell. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
comes on first in a red flowered robe, is advised by the neighbour
and goes off. The priests come on. The sounding of the bell is
the hinge of everything, a thing of great sentiment. As it is, in
reality, one of the most touching things in the world, it seemed to
me clever that there was no attempt to represent it. On the contrary,
the action centred in the toller, a cheery old gossiper used to the
job, who more or less spat on his hands and said Heave ho as he
swung the imaginary horizontal beam. Only when he had done so,
he continued his Heave ho in a kind of long echoing hum. Then he
danced. The mad mother came on in another dress, very strange,
light mauve gauze over white, no pattern, and the bough in her
hand. Why, when the old man had already tolled, for one’s imagination,
a non-existent bell in the real way with a heavy beam, the mother
should actually pull a coloured ribbon tied to an elaborate toy,
it is hard to say. But it is right.</p>

<p>“I saw this taken by Mansaburō, who, like his brother Rokurō,
has a beautiful voice. The singing is so unlike ours, that at first
one feels nothing about it. But after three or four performances
one notices, and I recognized the beauty of both these brothers’
voices before I knew they were brothers, or, indeed, that they
were noted in any way. In fact I was still in the state when I
had not yet realized that one might come to discussing the merits
of these players hidden in robes and masks as hotly as one discusses
the qualities of the favourites on the ordinary theatre.</p>

<p>“I don’t know if you know about the curtain. Every subsidiary
detail of the performance possesses, I don’t know how to say, but a
solidity. It’s there. God knows how it came there; but there it is,
and it’s not a contrivance, not an ‘idea.’ The entry to the stage, as you
know, is by a narrow gallery, beside which three little pine-trees rise
like mile-stones. This gallery ends with a single heavy curtain, which
does not rise as ours do, or draw aside or fall as in the Japanese
theatre. It sweeps back, only bellying a little. It is, in fact, as I saw
when I was allowed behind, lifted by poles fixed to the bottom corners.</p>

<p>“The poles are raised rapidly by two men kneeling a good way
behind. Suddenly the curtain blows back as by a wind, and the
expected figure, whom you know must be coming or something, i.&nbsp;e.
suspense is prepared by what has already happened, is framed in
the opening, and there pauses an instant. I am speaking, not of
the first entry, but of the second one, when the person who aroused
the pilgrim-visitor’s curiosity as a temple-sweeper or a water-carrier,
and vanished, reappears as the great General or princely Prime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
Minister he once was. The stage-wait necessitated by the change of
costume and mask is filled in by an interminable sayer of short
lines, with the same number of feet, each line detached from the
next as if the speaker were going from one afterthought to another.
He is a bystander&mdash;perhaps a shepherd in one play and a fisherman
in another&mdash;who knows something, and dilates on it to fill in time.
The musicians lay aside their drums. Everybody just waits. Up
sweeps the curtain, and with the re-entry of the revealed personage
comes the intenser and quicker second part for which the slow first
part was a preparation.”</p></div>

<h2><a id="APPENDIX_II"></a>APPENDIX II</h2>


<p>Some of the facts brought to light by the discovery of Seami’s
<i>Works</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(1) It had long been suspected that the current <i>Kwadensho</i> was not the work
of Seami. The discovery of the real <i>Kwadensho</i> has made this certain.</p>

<p>(2) Traditional dates of Kwanami and Seami corrected.</p>

<p>(3) It was supposed that only the music of the plays was written by their
nominal authors. The words were vaguely attributed to “Zen Priests.” We
now know that in most cases Kwanami and Seami played the triple part of
author,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> musical composer and actor.</p>

<p>(4) It was doubted whether in the fourteenth century Sarugaku had already
become a serious dramatic performance. We now know that it then differed
little (and in respect of seriousness not at all) from Nō as it exists to-day.</p>

<p>(5) It was supposed that the Chorus existed from the beginning. We now
learn from Seami that it was a novelty in 1430. Its absence must have been the
chief feature which distinguished the Sarugaku of the fourteenth century from
the Nō of to-day.</p>

<p>(6) Numerous passages prove that Nō at its zenith was not an exclusively
aristocratic art. The audiences were very varied.</p>

<p>(7) Seami gives details about the musical side of the plays as performed in
the fourteenth century. These passages, as is confessed even by the great Nō-scholar,
Suzuki Chōkō, could be discussed only by one trained in Nō-music.</p></div>
